### Introduction

The online and offline customer experience varies greatly. In a physical
store, customers use physical cues to assess the professionalism and
competency of an establishment. As you walk into a local electronics
store, it’s easy to evaluate professionalism by how the employees are
dressed, how you’re greeted, and the organization and cleanliness of the
store. The transaction process is familiar and you walk out of the store
with your purchase instantly. You instinctively know that if you have an
issue with the purchase, you can return to this location to seek
remedy.

For an ecommerce merchant, these cues are absent. The design, language,
processes, and content determine how a potential buyer perceives and
ultimately interacts with a business. For many consumers, trusting an
online merchant with payment information, to deliver the product on
time, and to provide service after the sale are potential impediments to
the buying process. The transaction process behind the transaction is
veiled and often unclear to the average user, plus online shopping
layers in added concerns about privacy and security further heightening
the perceived risk.

A positive customer experience leads to more sales and good word of
mouth. A negative experience not only diminishes the potential for
future sales, but can also lead to negative word of mouth that hinders
new customer acquisition. Even though technology has made building an
ecommerce empire easier than ever, ignoring the emotional and logical
cues that buyers need to feel secure and confident making an online
transaction can impede the growth of the best business models. This
document offers context around the importance of ecommerce customer
experience and guidance on how to evaluate and improve the experience
for your customers.

### Why Focus on Customer Experience?

Wanting to avoid the weekly trip to the grocery store, Michael Aldrich
pioneered electronic commerce in 1979 by successfully connecting his
television to a processing center via a phone line. By the 1990s, the
technology to support online shopping matured and is expected to grow to
$327 billion by 2016.<sup>1</sup> The new, tech-savvy consumer presents a unique
set of challenges to ecommerce merchants:

-   **Less quality time:** A web site must meet the need of its users
    and convince them to take action – in seconds. Recent research shows
    that while per visit revenue for ecommerce sites is increasing, the
    time spent on the site has decreased to about two and three-quarters
    minutes.<sup>2</sup> This puts even more pressure on ecommerce merchants
    to demonstrate value, communicate trust, and motivate action.

-   **Increased competition:** As ecommerce revenues grow, the number of
    players seeking a piece of the pie is slated to rise. The increased
    competition will force ecommerce shops to differentiate on more than
    just their product line or pricing. In surveys, 86% of shoppers are
    willing to pay more for a product or service for a better
    experience.<sup>3</sup> The new ecommerce shop must focus on creating an
    appropriate experience for customers at each stage of the buying
    cycle. For example, the customer experience of an apparel merchant
    will be dramatically different than that of an auto parts retailer.

-   **Speed of technology:** Technology is empowering the modern
    consumer. In the 90s, the only place for online shopping was the
    desktop computer. Today, consumers are connected to millions of
    shopping choices and mediums including PCs, tablets, and
    smartphones. As competition grows, customers expect seamless
    shopping experiences between online and offline channels. The
    proliferation of devices and the rise of alternate engagement
    platforms via social media and shopping apps offer merchants more
    opportunities to engage buyers while introducing added design and
    performance requirements to keep up.

### Elements of a Good Customer Experience

#### Site performance

The primary indicator of site performance is page load time. For each
second your page takes to load, customer satisfaction drops 7%.<sup>4</sup> The
majority of users expect your site to load in less than three
seconds.<sup>5</sup> However, recent research puts average load time for the top
2000 websites at ten seconds.<sup>6</sup> Nearly a third of dissatisfied
customers cite slow loading pages as the reason for dissatisfaction.<sup>7</sup>

Some factors that contribute to slow loading pages:

-   Uncompressed image and video files
-   Third-party scripts for social media, analytics, advertisements, location
data, and live chat scripts
-   Inadequate storage and content delivery mechanisms
-   Integration with payment portals, forums, or other add-ons
-   Latency between server requests over long distances

*If your page loads just a blink of the eye, about 250 milliseconds,
slower than your competitor, you could lose the sale.<sup>8</sup>*

#### Mobile ready

Mobile ecommerce sales have nearly doubled over the last two years
seeing 81% growth in 2012 and expected to rise another 55% in 2013.<sup>9</sup>
An ecommerce operator without a defined mobile strategy risks losing a
competitive advantage. Mobile strategy should include optimizing your
site and transaction processes for multiple devices and evaluating your
backend systems to ensure mobile accessibility and speed.

#### Hoe mobile-ready is your site?

-   Does your website display the same across all devices? A home page designed
for a desktop, could cause excessive scrolling on the part of smartphone or
tablet user viewing on a significantly smaller screen.
-   Are your images and video files displaying properly? Images and video
intended for larger screens often don’t display well or function properly on
mobile devices.
-   Are form entry areas and touch targets apparent? Space out text entry fields,
buttons, and other action points to accommodate finger tapping as opposed to a
cursor clicking. Consider replacing text with icons to reduce screen text.
-   Do you rely on pop-ups for newsletter registration, surveys, or specials?
Navigating multiple browser pages or tabs isn’t as easy on a mobile device. If
these elements are critical, consider incorporating them into on-page content.
-   Have you incorporated mobile-specific features to your site? Mobile offers
extra features like click-to-call and navigation options for brick and mortar
locations.

*84% of US adults experience difficulty completing mobile transactions.<sup>10</sup>*

#### Site usability

A multi-platform accessible, high-performing site can still fail if the
site design is difficult to navigate or has elements that don’t work.
Ecommerce shops left an estimated $44 billion on the table because of
shopping cart errors, broken links, and other transaction problems.<sup>11</sup>
Improvements in usability, like upgrading navigation and information
flow, can deliver up to 83% return on investment.<sup>12</sup>

#### Common website usability issues

Inconsistent design: When a page looks different than other pages on a
site, users could spend more time figuring out if they arrived on the
right page instead of digesting product offerings.

-   **Broken elements:** Whether it’s a broken link or a video that doesn’t
play, having functionality on your site that doesn’t work causes users to lose
confidence in a business.
-   **Confusing text:** Headings and lists should be arranged so that users can
quickly scan for pertinent information. The words used to describe products,
communicate specials, or guide users through the checkout process must be free
of jargon, unfamiliar acronyms, and bad grammar for maximum clarity.
-   **Poor site organization:** In order to build navigation and links to support
users, the ecommerce operator must understand the logical process users employ
to make purchase decisions. Implementing user testing and reviewing analytics
can help identify barriers or gaps in the purchase path.

*Large online and offline retailer, Nordstrom’s, recently invested
millions into usability and site upgrades yielding a 37% growth in
ecommerce channel sales.<sup>13</sup>*

### Experience Design in Action at Rackspace

We’ve spent much time and energy infusing principles of customer
experience into our main website as well as into the design of our
control panel and support structure. At Rackspace, we designed our
customer experience around these four principles:

1.  It’s not good enough to just design great products. Products need
    to reflect the values embodied by our employees — simple and
    intuitive.
2.  User interfaces (not just technology, but all touch points) need to
    be consistent with the Rackspace brand. This is about fundamental
    experiences, not just appearance. Before we worry too much about
    look and feel, we must consider whether we’re designing the right
    product and how well it is designed.
3.  Interactions with employees and the pro duct need to be part of a
    coherent experience. In other words, the interactions themselves
    need to be perceived as supportive.
4.  When we design systems, we must think of them not just as pieces of
    software, but also as a whole chain of cause and effect moments that
    makes up an experience, which can include user, employee, and
    electronic (automated) actions.

### Summary

We’ve presented some high-level elements to get you thinking about the
customer experience on your retail website. Determining which steps to
take next is highly dependent on the type of user experience strategy
you’ve set forth and the current state of your site's architecture.
Often the biggest barrier to improving the quality of the customer
experience is lack of infrastructure capacity and IT expertise to speed
up page loads or deliver content over distance. Need help meeting the
infrastructure requirements of creating your ideal user experience?
