### Introduction

As businesses of every size rely more and more on their technology
infrastructure to provide them with a competitive advantage, cloud
computing and related technologies have emerged as potential
game-changers. The most intense focus has been on finding ways to
leverage cloud computing with minimum disruption to business processes
and maximum return on investment. The result has been the rise of hybrid
hosting. Because hybrid hosting offers significant advantages to its
users, the technology has become the solution of choice for a growing
number of businesses. Gartner, which rates the benefit of hybrid cloud
computing as “Transformational,” observes that “It also sets the stage for
new ways for enterprises to work with suppliers, partners (B2B) and customers
(business-to-consumer) as these constituencies also move toward a hybrid
cloud-computing model.”<sup>1</sup> We will begin, then, with a big-picture
look at hybrid hosting.

### Overview of hybrid hosting

Hybrid hosting, an approach that combines components of dedicated
hosting and cloud hosting in a single solution, allows businesses to
switch seamlessly between dedicated hosted services and cloud services,
or use both simultaneously, as needed. In particular, hybrid hosting
solutions recognize that a business will have different sets of
requirements for different types of computing needs as well as
requirements associated with specific types of applications.

For mission-critical applications, including line-of-business and
proprietary applications, stability and security requirements may point
to the need for dedicated hosting. Usage associated with promotional
events and campaigns, or any application that experiences highly
variable traffic and usage patterns, may be better suited to scalable
cloud solutions.

Rather than forcing businesses to choose just one platform, hybrid
hosting gives businesses access to both, integrating the strengths of
each seamlessly without incurring unnecessary costs and without
introducing undesirable complexity. As a result, “the bulk of
business computing will shift out of private data centers to the cloud,”
according to noted technology author Nicholas Carr.<sup>2</sup> To look at what
that shift entails, we will examine next the basic elements of hybrid
hosting.

### Elements of hybrid hosting

Most enterprise computing today takes place in-house, on hardware owned
and managed by the companies that use it. Because a conservative
approach to capacity planning calls for companies to size their
infrastructure based on anticipated peak needs, the typical
non-virtualized in-house server is in use only ten percent of the
time.<sup>3</sup> By contrast, servers used in cloud hosting are more highly
utilized, more efficiently utilized, and can provide computing that is
cost efficient, faster, and more capable. Similarly, a 2008 reader
survey conducted by CIO Magazine found that “58% say cloud computing
will cause a radical shift in IT and 47% say they are already using it
or actively researching it.”<sup>4</sup> In short, the trend is toward
enterprises retiring legacy systems, moving to webbased environments,
and showing an increasing preference for buying IT as a service.

#### Limitations of Cloud

While cloud computing provides numerous benefits in its scalability,
flexibility and utility billing model, it is not necessarily the ideal
platform for all applications. In cases where businesses require a high
degree of security, extensive customization, or when maximum performance
is essential, a dedicated server may provide a more desirable
alternative. We will consider security concerns in depth below.

#### Increasing Expectations

The increasing availability of cloud computing technologies, driven by a
growing number of cloud hosting vendors, has helped businesses become
more familiar with — and more comfortable using — cloud computing
solutions. As businesses begin to unlock the value of cloud computing
for their particular IT environments, they may, in turn, become aware of
the vast potential cloud computing and hybrid hosting solutions offer.
Consequently, businesses are becoming both better educated and more
demanding. According to a report from IDC, this increased familiarity
with the potential that hybrid computing represents is “spelling an end
to what has been a honeymoon period in the public and hybrid
cloud-computing markets.”<sup>5</sup> Vendors that provide hybrid hosting
solutions must adapt to these expectations in order to remain
competitive. Moreover, they must understand the issues that could slow
cloud adoption and find ways to help businesses overcome those issues.

#### Easing the Migration

Moving legacy applications to the cloud can have significant benefits.
Allowing connectivity between on- and off-premise dedicated physical
server resources and cloud-based computing resources provides many
options to match the right workload or application to the right
platform. With that added flexibility, developers start to think in
terms of which platform works best for which piece of their
application, allowing for creative architectures that were not possible
even a year ago.

However, legacy applications may require recoding before they can take
advantage of the flexibility and scalability of cloud computing.
Moreover, recoding can be both expensive and time-consuming.

A hybrid model permits a novel solution to the recoding problem. A
hybrid platform allows companies to begin to move their applications to
a cloud platform a piece at a time, avoiding an expensive, top-to-bottom
rewrite entirely or, at a minimum, splitting the task into manageable
phases.

Some of the easier application components to move to the cloud include
batch job processing, web and storage tiers, and test and development
environments. By connecting back to the physical server infrastructure,
companies can avoid the more intensive database re-architecture projects
and keep their relational database on fast I/O dedicated servers.

As vendors find ways to make the cloud more accessible to businesses,
they must have an answer for a key concern businesses have around cloud
hosting: security.

### Hybrid hosting and security

All the concerns that apply to data security in traditional IT
infrastructure environments apply to both cloud and hybrid hosting
environments, along with additional concerns unique to the cloud. To
bring structure to security considerations around cloud and hybrid
computing, organizations such as the non-profit Cloud Security
Alliance(CSA) provide education on, and promote best practices for,
security in cloud computing.<sup>6</sup>

The CSA divides security issues into two broad categories. The first
category relates to issues of governance, such as:

- legal and electronic discovery,
- compliance and audit, and
- information lifecycle management.

The second category focuses on issues that are more operational nature,
and includes:

- application security,
- encryption and key management, and
- identity and access management.

Businesses can evaluate the security measures provided by their cloud
and hybrid hosting vendors in the context of the guidelines set forth by
the CSA and similar organizations.

Hybrid hosting models can offer a different security approach than a
cloud-only hosting solution, because dedicated security appliances are
paired with cloud resources. Hybrid Hosting at Rackspace, for example,
allows a company to leverage a dedicated hardware firewall in front of
their cloud servers to provide granular security to their cloud based
application. The Company can further enhance security by adding DDoS
(distributed denial of service) prevention appliances.

In addition, for applications with specific compliance requirements(such
as ecommerce applications that must pass PCI DSS audits for accepting
and processing credit card transactions and data) secure data can reside
on dedicated physical servers and databases isolated from other portions
of the website, such as the public product catalog. The catalog, by
contrast, could move to cloud servers to allow responsive scaling to
fluctuating traffic patterns. By combining dedicated and cloud hosting
in this manner, it is possible to address many of the security and
compliance concerns of a fully cloud-based solution today.

Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> capabilities in hybrid hosting

Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Hosting is a leading provider of hybrid hosting
capabilities. With extensive experience in both dedicated hosting and cloud
computing, Rackspace recognizes that customers require the ability to combine
physical and cloud based resources. In 2010, Rackspace launched an
offering to fill this need.
Called [RackConnect<sup>&trade;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/),
the offering allows customers to seamlessly link cloud computing and
traditional hosting together with enhanced user control and security.

#### RackConnect<sup>&trade;</sup> Hosting Solution

When a customer selects the RackConnect<sup>&trade;</sup> service, Rackspace
performs an initial setup process to connect the customer’s dedicated servers
to its cloud account. Customers can choose to use a dedicated firewall or
application delivery controller to act as a router between the
environments as well as to automatically provision access controls, to
ensure their dedicated environment remains secure. This connection
occurs entirely within the Rackspace datacenter over a private network,
ensuring traffic flows at wirespeed and remains isolated from the
Internet.

Rackspace can further perform wild card pattern matching based on server
name or metadata assigned to the cloud servers, and then add the cloud
resource appropriately to application or web server resource pools. As
customers spin cloud servers up and down at-will, RackConnect<sup>&trade;</sup>
automatically adds and removes these servers to and from the appropriate
resource pools. With RackConnect<sup>&trade;</sup> providing context, we turn
next to use cases that demonstrate the potential business advantages of hybrid
hosting technology.

### Hybrid hosting for flexibility and scaling

Among the most significant uses for hybrid hosting is the case of
scalable web applications. Dedicated servers, including highperformance
custom servers for intensive I/O operations such as databases and file
access, support predictable loads. Cloud servers allow for bursting
during times of peak demand. Combining the two allows businesses to size
the physical environment to average loads and minimize hosting costs by
shifting peak loads to utility-priced cloud, incurring costs only when
cloud resources are in use. The combined platforms also improve the time
to bring additional capacity online, ensuring that applications stay
available even when traffic spikes quickly.

A second use case for hybrid hosting is connecting production
environments to test and development environments. By moving test and
dev platforms to the cloud, developers can have direct access to test
servers, alleviating the burden on IT managers, speeding development
cycles, and reducing the costs of unused test server capacity.
Additionally, connecting cloud-based test and development servers
directly to production can speed and simplify code deployments, enabling
short development and release cycles while also simplifying release
operations. Similarly, regression testing and quality assurance
activities can operate at scale using the cloud, since businesses can provision
many cloud servers simultaneously to emulate a fully loaded environment. With
dedicated hardware, this scale of testing can be cost-prohibitive, but the
cloud’s pay-as-you-go pricing model can make such load testing cost-effective
today.

A third use case, and one rapidly gaining prominence, is one in which
businesses use hybrid hosting to enable Software as a Service (SaaS)
offerings for customers. In cases of software packages developed for
client server deployment, businesses can move them to the cloud rather
than rewriting the entire software package as a multi-tenant web-based
solution. This allows each customer to maintain a dedicated instance of
the application on his or her own cloud server. The SaaS vendor can then
connect dedicated physical servers to the cloud server environment to
manage the provisioning, store customer data securely, and provide
administration, configuration, and management capabilities for the
overall solution.

The common thread in all of these scenarios is the cost-effectiveness
and flexibility of hybrid platform solutions. Rackspace enables these
cost efficiencies in numerous ways, and key among them is Rackspace’s
choice of AMD technology.

### AMD Opteron<sup>&trade;</sup> server platforms for hybrid hosting

To derive the full benefit of cloud hosting’s potential as a
comparatively low-cost approach, Rackspace needed servers to use highly
efficient processors that were competitively-priced. Conversely, to meet
the volatile, potentially high demands of hybrid hosting environments,
those same processors had to meet stringent requirements for
performance, I/O capabilities and low energy consumption. Rackspace
chose to base their critical cloud infrastructure on servers based on
AMD Opteron<sup>&trade;</sup> 4000 Series and AMD Opteron<sup>&trade;</sup>
6000 Series platforms because they offer these qualities.

The AMD Opteron<sup>&trade;</sup> 6000 Series platform is based on the AMD
Direct Connect Architecture 2.0 with up to 48 total cores in a 4P configuration.
This platform more than doubles the memory bandwidth<sup>7</sup>, and provides nearly
twice the I/O bandwidth of previous generation 2P and 4P servers.<sup>8</sup> For
optimal cost-effectiveness, the AMD Opteron<sup>&trade;</sup> 4100 Series
processor, part of the AMD Opteron<sup>&trade;</sup> 4000 Series platform, is
the world’s lowest power per core server processor,<sup>9</sup> serving as the foundation
for hybrid cloud workloads and affordability with sub-$100 pricing per CPU.<sup>10</sup>

With these two platforms, AMD enables cloud hosting vendors to offer
users optimal levels of performance, power management, and cost
efficiency for hosting environments. Since both of these processors are
based on the same core technology, they also offer a level of
compatibility that allows the mixing of servers with either processor
type without causing major management headaches. Workloads can easily
scale between the two because of the high degree of platform
commonality.

### Case Study: Hybrid hosting for flexibility and scalability

Major League Gaming(MLG), one of the largest online professional video gaming
leagues in the world, represents the world’s best professional gamers,
and offers millions of aspiring gamers the chance to compete, practice
and socialize via MLG’s massive network of sites.

To enable that interactivity, the MLG website supports resource-heavy
applications with millions of user posts, game demos, recordings of past
competitions, and other game-related media, with highly variable
traffic. MLG turned to Rackspace to deliver that infrastructure.
Rackspace provides a full portfolio of hosting platforms, including
hybrid hosting, delivering instant scale and storage combined with
dedicated gear for MLG’s security-sensitive applications. Tapping
Rackspace for hybrid hosting allowed MLG to focus resources on their
core strategic goals. As a result, MLG has been able to launch new user
experiences faster, handle variable traffic without buying more
hardware, and allow developers to perform system administration tasks.

#### Increased Speed

Previously using only dedicated hardware, MLG lacked the flexibility to
deliver an optimal user experience. The optimal experience for their
users requires both platform availability and a fast time to market for
new applications. With a hybrid hosting environment, MLG gained the
ability to treat the machine as a component of the application that they
could modify as needed, eliminating the need to uninstall, clean, and
rebuild for each new use.

#### Reduced Cost

Where hybrid hosting delivered the biggest cost benefit for MLG was in
the ability to temporarily provision extra capacity to cover big events
and launches. The hybrid environment delivered resources during game
launches and live events, both of which dramatically increase traffic
for a short period of time. Just as important, MLG minimized the costs
of unused capacity between peaks.

### Conclusion

Hybrid hosting technologies hold tremendous potential. Though not a
silver bullet, the technologies enable flexibility that is critical for
business today. In order to support the full spectrum of customer
requirements, a hybrid approach of cloud and dedicated hosting solutions
makes the most sense.
