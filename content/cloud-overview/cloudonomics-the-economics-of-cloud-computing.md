### Executive Summary

There are many reasons for organizations to move from traditional IT
infrastructure to Cloud Computing. One of the most cited benefits is the
economics of the Cloud. Yet while many people point out the cost savings
that Cloud Computing brings to an organization, we believe attention
should be drawn to four distinct mechanisms through which these cost
savings are generated;

- By lowering the opportunity cost of running technology
- By allowing for a shift from capital expenditure to operating expenditure
- By lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO) of technology
- By giving organizations the ability to add business value by renewed focus on
core activities

In this paper we detail these four mechanisms and introduce several case
studies and examples to show the increased economic value that Cloud
Computing brings to an organization.

### The Problem with the 80-20 Rule

The 80-20 rule is often used within organizations to illustrate the
large effects that small variables can have. It was first suggested by
business management thinker Joseph Juran and originally called the
Pareto principle <sup>1</sup> after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. Rather
than an absolute measure, it tends to be a generalization that is
intended to make a point about distribution curves. The most well known
use of the rule is the sales 80-20 rule which says that 80% of revenue
for a business is derived from 20% of customers.

Information Technology has its own series of 80-20 rules. As we detailed
in a previous CloudU report <sup>2</sup>  Gartner estimates that IT maintenance
accounts for around 80% of total IT expenditure <sup>3</sup>.

However we contend that the 80-20 rule occurs elsewhere within IT and
relates to time, just as must as it relates to monetary costs. When we
look at organizations running their own data center infrastructure, and
extend Gartner’s findings, we hypothesize that only 20% of the time and
effort that goes into running applications, where all business value is
concentrated, is actually concerned with running those applications
themselves. The diagram below illustrates the extent that routine and
non-core tasks, like patching operating systems and performing backups,
impact upon the time of IT departments.

Cloud Computing is a force that helps flip this ratio and gives IT
departments the ability to spend 80% of their time on core business
processes, like business application design. It’s for this reason, the
ability to go from 20% of time and money dedicated to core business
processes to 80%, that the economics of Cloud Computing is so
compelling. Nowhere is the current model’s inefficiency more evident
than in the opportunity costs that organizations pay to manage their own
computing needs.

### Remember the Opportunity Cost


Opportunity cost, a concept first developed by British philosopher John
Stuart Mill, is a basic economic premise that is concerned with the
costs related to the choices NOT made by someone. Opportunity cost is:

> ... the cost related to the next-best choice available to someone who has picked among 
several mutually exclusive choices. It is a key concept in economics…. opportunity costs 
are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost 
time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered 
opportunity costs <sup>4</sup>

Opportunity cost is an important concept when discussing the economics
of Cloud Computing because it allows one to assess the true cost of any
potential action. When choosing a particular direction for IT spend, for
example, there may be no direct cost attached to maintaining the status
quo - data centers have already been built, software purchased. However
by including opportunity costs in any calculation, an organization
allows for a truer comparison between the various choices to be made.

With this explanation of opportunity cost, we can now apply the concept
to a decision to either retain on-premise IT or move to the Cloud. As
we’ve already seen, roughly 80% of IT time and expenditure is wasted on
processes that don’t create any value for the organization (beyond
maintaining the status quo). The opportunity cost of not choosing the
Cloud is therefore the benefit that can accrue to the organization
through optimal utilization of that 80%. To put it simplistically, a
move to the Cloud can make the difference between an organization being
20% efficient, and one being 80% efficient.

While opportunity cost, and the value to be gained by reducing that
cost, is a compelling benefit of moving to Cloud Computing, many
critical readers will want to see more concrete examples of the
economics at work. To this end it is important to understand the gains
to be made from a move away from capital expenditure, and over to
operating expenditure.

### OpEx is the New CapEx

Traditional IT expenditure has been very capital intensive. Hardware had
to be bought outright and software licenses were generally an
expenditure that appeared on the balance sheet. For this reason the
decision making process for technology spend became very drawn out.


One of the core tenets of Cloud Computing is that it is a recurring
expenditure model and - as we detailed in a previous report <sup>5</sup>  is
much like telephone or electricity expenditure in that it is accounted
for as a standard operating expense.

There are several distinct reasons that OpEx, or operating expenditure,
is preferred to CapEx, or capital expenditure.

**Financial Considerations**

OpEx is beneficial for the organization, as it gives it the flexibility
to terminate costs at will. With a capital purchase, the server or
software being acquired is fully committed to. Regardless of whether it
is being utilized, the ongoing costs (by way of depreciation or
financing costs) still need to be borne. Contrast this with OpEx where,
in the event that the item is no longer required, payments can cease
rapidly. It is for this reason that many companies prefer leasing
vehicles in place of purchasing them outright.

While it is true that organizations pay a premium per unit for the
flexibility to be able to suspend service, as we will see elsewhere in
the report, the total cost of ownership of owned assets is much higher
as demonstrated in the chart below <sup>6</sup>

<img src="{% asset_path cloud-overview/cloudonomics-the-economics-of-cloud-computing/economicchart.png %}" />

**Allows Business Units to Decide**

Most organizations have relatively strict rules in place for all but the
most simple of capital expenditure spending. Operating expenditure
however tends to be more frequently delegated to individual business
units. In this way, and in keeping with the democratization that is
attendant with Cloud Computing <sup>8</sup>], individual business units have the
ability to acquire technology that answers their particular business
needs. This flexibility at the business unit, and even individual level,
is in fact one of the major forces that is contributing to the growth of
Cloud Computing. While sometimes lauded, and sometimes lamented in the
press<sup>9</sup>], “rouge” departments in larger organizations are often the
first to experiment with Cloud Computing and the first to experience the
economic benefits that go along with it.

***Overcomes Expenditure Limitations***

Acquiring capital for large purchases is difficult, for all sizes of
organization. This is especially true for smaller organizations for
which finance companies apply rigorous debt to equity ratios and thus
the amount of capital they can acquire. For this reason it has
historically been difficult for organizations to sufficiently justify
capital expenditure to get approval for many projects. Moving to an OpEx
model removes this limitation and allows small scale projects to be
undertaken, unconstrained by capital considerations.

While a move away from CapEx is undoubtedly attractive to organizations,
it is via Total Cost of Ownership that the economic benefits of Cloud
Computing become most clear.

### Total Cost of Ownership

As mentioned previously in this report, when comparing costs between
on-premise options and Cloud Computing, it is important to accurately
assess the true costs of both options. It’s important to remember that,
with the Cloud, most costs are up front and readily calculated – this is
due to a number of factors, including the following:

- Cloud providers give transparent pricing based on different usage
metrics - RAM, storage, bandwidth, among others
- Pricing is frequently fixed per unit of time. Customers gain
certainty over pricing and are then able to readily calculate costs
based on several different usage estimates
- Compare this to on-premise technology. In a recent article for
CIO.com <sup>10</sup>, Bernard Golden discussed why direct cost-comparisons
between the Cloud and on-premise are difficult. As he points out,
calculations of in-house costs fail to take into account;
- The direct costs that accompany running a server: power, floor
space, storage, and IT operations to manage those resources
- The indirect costs of running a server: network and storage
infrastructure and IT operations to manage the general
infrastructure.
- The overhead costs of owning a server: procurement and accounting
personnel, not to mention a critical resource in short supply: IT
management and its attention.

All of these hidden costs make a direct cost comparison difficult.
However to help in calculating true TCO, Jonathan Koomey from Stanford
University wrote a paper several years ago entitled “A Simple Model for
Determining the True Total Cost of Ownership for Data Centers” <sup>11</sup>.
As part of the paper, Koomey developed a spreadsheet to aid in the
calculation of True TCO for data centers <sup>12</sup>  which can be used in
costs comparisons.

Despite these cost savings however, we believe Cloud Computing offers
significant extra value to organizations by merit of the fact that it
allows them to focus on their core business. It is our contention that
this value side of the equation is even more compelling than any cost
savings possible.

**Case Study: Gregory/Ricochet fashions a TCO win using Software-as-a-Service**

Vend <sup>13</sup>  is an online point-of-sale (POS) application, with the
backend run entirely by cloud hosting provider, Rackspace &reg; Hosting. Vend
built their retail POS application, VendHQ, from the ground up to
leverage the benefits of Cloud Computing and provide the cost saving
benefits and no stress infrastructure management to retail business
owners. Gregory/Ricochet <sup>14</sup> is a fashion retailer with 12 stores
spread across New Zealand. They previously hosted their own server
infrastructure internally to provide the retail platform, and POS for
all their stores which required a private network, creating problems
keeping all 12 stores in sync.

Before considering Cloud Computing, Gregory/Ricochet’s IT budget was
$30K per annum (not including hardware) which covered;

- Server maintenance of their internally hosted retail platform
- IT support for each of the stores POS and upgrades
- IT support of the Head Office infrastructure and network
- Remote backup services

Gregory/Ricochet moved to the Vend cloud retail platform to run their
in-store front counters, back office, and manufacturing and distribution
centre. They also moved to other Cloud Applications including Google
apps <sup>15</sup> for mail, calendaring and contacts, DropBox <sup>16</sup> for
sharing file and documents, and Xero <sup>17</sup> for accounting.

Using VendHQ, they can manage their users, product catalogue, and get
real-time statistics on their retail stores from any computer, while no
longer having to manage an internal network.

From an economic perspective, the savings are impressive. Total software
subscriptions are now around US$350 per month, and they maintain no
internal servers or network other than a simple WiFi network. Their IT
support requirements are now much simpler as well, significantly
reducing IT support costs. Finally, Gregory/Ricochet had to buy no new
hardware to move to the new platform, and migrated the entire operation
in only a couple of weeks with minimal consulting expense.


### Time is Money: Focus on What Matters

A recurring theme among Cloud proponents is the fact that Cloud
Computing enables organizations to focus on their core business. In the
same way that we consider it bizarre that, given widespread availability
of electricity on tap, an organization might create their own
electricity plant to power their factory, so too is it becoming more
bizarre to host one’s own software or buy one’s own hardware. Recently
Netflix, the nearly $10 billion online video rental and streaming
service, posted <sup>18</sup>] an article detailing their decisions to move to
Cloud Computing infrastructure. It is worth reviewing their rationale,
in particular a deciding factor that directly relates to focusing on
core activities. As Netflix says:

> The problems the Cloud hosting company is trying to solve are incredibly difficult ones, 
but they aren’t specific to our business. Every successful internet company has to figure 
out great storage solutions, hardware failover, networking infrastructure, etc.

> We want our engineers to focus as much of their time as possible on product innovation 
for the Netflix customer experience; that is what differentiates us from our competitors ...

> We chose to be pioneers in this transition to the Cloud so we could leverage our 
investment as we grow, rather than to double down on a model we expect will decline in the 
industry.

While it can be difficult to assign a direct economic benefit to the
ability to focus on core business processes and abstract responsibility
for non-core activities to a third party, we consider it analogous to
specialization of labor. In the 18th Century, Economist Adam Smith
described in The Wealth of Nations <sup>19</sup>, the production of a pin in
the following way <sup>20</sup>:

> One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, 
a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head: to make the head requires two or 
three distinct operations: to put it on is a particular business, to whiten the pins is 
another ... and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into 
about eighteen distinct operations

Smith goes on to estimate somewhere between a 240 and 4800 fold increase
in productivity by a specialization of labor of this sort. It is our
view that Cloud Computing will drive benefits for organizational focus
akin to those that Smith witnessed in the pin factory.

### Conclusion

We believe that there are significant economic benefits to be gained
from a move to Cloud Computing. These benefits accrue to a business in
two distinct ways – directly through reduced costs and indirectly by
allowing for increased focus on core business functions.

We stress however, and have covered in a previous report <sup>21</sup>, that
there are multiple forces at work leading to the growth of Cloud
Computing. The economics are but one of these forces and, as such, we
urge organizations considering the Cloud to look at broader benefits and
impacts beyond pure economics. Many of these benefits will be covered in
future CloudU reports.

### Appendix

#### The Ten Laws of Cloudonomics

In 2008, Joe Weinman, then Strategic Solutions Sales VP for AT&T Global
Business Services, created the 10 Laws of Cloudonomics <sup>22</sup>  that
still, after two and a half years, are the foundation for the economics
of Cloud Computing. We’ve reproduced an abridged version of the
Cloudonomics laws below.

**Cloudonomics Law #1:** Utility services cost less even though they
cost more. Although utilities cost more when they are used, they cost
nothing when they are not. Consequently, customers save money by
replacing fixed infrastructure with Clouds when workloads are spiky,
specifically when the peak-to-average ratio is greater than the utility
premium.

**Cloudonomics Law #2:** On-demand trumps forecasting. Forecasting is
often wrong, the ability to up and down scale to meet unpredictable
demand spikes allows for revenue and cost optimalities.

**Cloudonomics Law #3:** The peak of the sum is never greater than the
sum of the peaks. Enterprises deploy capacity to handle their peak
demands. Under this strategy, the total capacity deployed is the sum of
these individual peaks. However, since clouds can reallocate resources
across many enterprises with different peak periods, a cloud needs to
deploy less capacity.

**Cloudonomics Law #4:** Aggregate demand is smoother than individual.
Aggregating demand from multiple customers tends to smooth out
variation. Therefore, Clouds get higher utilization, enabling better
economics.

**Cloudonomics Law #5:** Average unit costs are reduced by distributing
fixed costs over more units of output. Larger cloud providers can
therefore achieve some economies of scale.

**Cloudonomics Law #6:** Superiority in numbers is the most important
factor in the result of a combat (Clausewitz). Service providers have
the scale to fight rogue attacks.

**Cloudonomics Law #7:** Space-time is a continuum. Organizations
derive competitive advantage from responding to changing business
conditions faster than the competition. With Cloud scalability, for the
same cost, a business can accelerate its information processing and
decision-making.

**Cloudonomics Law #8:** Dispersion is the inverse square of latency.
Reduced latency is increasingly essential to modern applications. A
Cloud Computing provider is able to provide more nodes, and hence
reduced latency, than an enterprise would want to deploy.

**Cloudonomics Law #9:** Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. The
reliability of a system increases with the addition of redundant,
geographically dispersed components such as data centers. Cloud
Computing vendors have the scale and diversity to do so.

**Cloudonomics Law #10:** An object at rest tends to stay at rest. A
data center is a very large object. Private data centers tend to remain
in locations for reasons such as where the company was founded, or where
they got a good deal on property. A Cloud service provider can locate
greenfield sites optimally.

Weinman has since expanded the Laws to cover “irrational” cognitive
biases <sup>23</sup> and provided a number of detailed proofs of the Laws
<sup>24</sup>.
