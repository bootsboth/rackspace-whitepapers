### Abstract

Cloud computing is one of the hottest topics in enterprise IT today.
However, amidst all the hype and misinformation, it is critical that
enterprise decision makers consider the Cloud as a viable strategic
resource for their IT environment. This whitepaper discusses the IT
challenges enterprises face and how the Cloud can help overcome those
challenges. it then defines different Cloud configurations and the most
appropriate uses of each. Finally, it provides guidance on enterprise
decision-making regarding Cloud applications and platforms.

### Introduction

Enterprise computing is at a major inflection point. The combination of
rapid technological advancement and the economic realities of our time
have given rise to the Cloud Computing Era. Much like the historical
mainframe and client-server eras, the advent of the Cloud is
fundamentally changing the way we consume computing resources. Cloud
computing allows enterprises to share resources, software and
information across a rapidly growing multitude of connected devices,
creating new opportunities for business speed and efficiency.

Today’s economy requires the fundamental cost structure of IT to
change. Recent studies show that 70% of IT budget is spent on systems
maintenance while only 30% is available for productivity-enhancing
innovation. Business leaders desire exactly the opposite: a model
where the majority of budgets support innovation, and less is spent just
“keeping the lights on.” The goal is to find better service delivery
models that allocate more IT budget toward innovation and business
value. So CEOs, CFOs, CIOs and IT executives are demanding computing
solutions that provide cutting-edge performance, enhanced availability,
bulletproof reliability, and massive and rapid scalability, all within a
cost-efficient envelope that keeps their enterprises fast and lean.

### Business problems with traditional IT

Enterprises today face a myriad of obstacles in their IT environments.
Complex systems, overburdened human resources, and large capital
expenditure requirements create bottlenecks in deployment of new
computing resources and capabilities. Because of this, most IT
organizations cannot deploy assets or applications quickly or maintain
them cost-effectively. A closer look at each of these challenges reveals
a set of causes and effects that even further complicate enterprises’
ability to keep IT agile and flexible.

#### Slow technological lag

First, there is a lag between modern technology and its thoughtful
implementation across an enterprise’s employees, systems and processes.
in other words, internal IT departments struggle to keep their
enterprise up to date on the best available software and hardware. it’s
not for lack of trying, but technology changes at breakneck speed. This
phenomenon is encapsulated in Moore’s Law, which states that computing
capability increases 1 percent every week – an astronomical rate of
change. On the flip side of this axiom is what’s known as Moore’s Flaw:
keeping up with the flood of innovation quickly becomes too difficult
and too costly for an IT organization to manage. Just as Moore’s Law
compounds the speed of technology, Moore’s Flaw is multiplied by the
fact that many enterprises have technology systems that have been
piecemealed together over time and/or inherited through acquisitions or
mergers.

Considering all of this, technological advancement at the
enterprise IT level often involves moving the 900-pound gorilla of
working through such complicated systems. and even if enterprises can
achieve that, then comes the assessment, alteration and maintenance of
the processes and people affected by such sweeping changes. Thus, the
complexity of technology, along with the adjustments and training needed
to adopt it, make its enterprise-level implementation slow to a crawl.
Optimizing environments through the calculated use of IT hosting
provides a much easier, quicker and less expensive option.

#### Overburdened resources

Second, enterprises’ human resources in IT are overburdened in today’s
economy. With the growth of business needs, innovation is demanded
within ever-tightening budgets. Many businesses have reallocated human
resources in order to focus on core competencies, and most IT
departments have been forced to do more with current (or fewer)
resources and/or that which incurs little cost. Most enterprises simply
cannot justify additional IT headcount if it will primarily be used on
systems maintenance and will not provide new productivity. The
consequence of this unfortunate, but necessary, reaction to the market
is increased difficulty for IT organizations to address current business
needs, much less provide productivity and innovation. Performing more
tasks with fewer resources spreads IT resources thin. This also further
compounds the aforementioned sluggishness of technological adoption at
the enterprise level. Therefore, companies further strain their
resources by asking them to bear the weight of both current,
ever-evolving business demands and the necessity of increased productivity.

#### High capital expenditures

Finally, enterprises face the challenge of costly IT capital
expenditures required to accommodate their size and scope. Organizations
have had to support the full cost of hardware, infrastructure and
technical resources themselves, which means they often fail to achieve
the optimal mix of resources, overpay for scarce resources, and go
without needed specialists that could help provide real business value.

A prime instance of these compounding costs is when traditional
enterprise capacity planning causes wasteful over-provisioning. In IT
departments, demand for a service is usually cyclical. For example,
e-commerce traffic for many retailers spikes near the end of the year
due to holiday shopping and then retreats to lower levels at other times
of the year. Alternatively, a website could realize traffic spikes
because of a Super Bowl ad while having slower run rate traffic. So,
provisioning a data center for peak load leads to underutilization of
resources at other times. And even though all of the additional
computing resources provisioned to serve peak demand may go unused
during cyclical troughs, the enterprise is still left footing the bill
for the full set of resources.

Another example of IT cost inefficiency is exposed when organizations
perform batch processing, high-performance computing or Monte Carlo
simulations. These efforts involve building data centers and computer
systems consisting of hundreds or thousands of computers in order to
perform a large number of required calculations. Such data centers and
computer systems require vast capital expenditures that, like the
computing resources for traffic spikes mentioned above, will likely go
underutilized at some point in the future. Going back to Moore’s Law,
those physical assets will become obsolete in a matter of a few years,
requiring costly new hardware and application migration projects, making
investment even less economical. all these costs – infrastructure, human
resources and specialists – and their compounding tendencies add up to a
dubious debit on the balance sheet that represents yet another IT
handicap for enterprises to overcome.

In summary, traditional enterprise IT can be too slow, too busy and too
costly for organizations that need increasing agility and productivity.
as the overall consequence, enterprises today get less productivity from
internal resources, resulting in a loss of business and/or a loss of
business growth. and it is easy to see the frustration that everyone
from executives to the frontline employees feels whenever technological
change or innovation is needed, but unavailable. Cloud computing and
dedicated hosting have emerged to solve many of these problems.

### The emergence of the cloud

[Cloud computing](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/) and [dedicated
hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/index.php), when
implemented thoughtfully, can be secure, cost-effective, flexible,
scalable, and fast. These traits allow it to provide what IT has and will
always need: a way to increase capacity on the fly without investing in
new infrastructure, training new and existing personnel, and licensing
new software. But before diving into how the Cloud can deliver on its
promise to solve many of the business problems of IT, it is worth
defining “the Cloud” and dedicated hosting and how they can be used together.

#### Shifting focus from hardware to software

Enterprise hosting services are not a revolutionary concept. For
decades, utility companies have hosted power generation for users, and
telephone companies have hosted voice and data services for their
subscribers. In similar fashion, today’s IT hosting companies are
providing businesses with services such as data center hosting,
computing and data storage. As a result, the buying decision shifts from
purchasing products that enable the delivery of services (a Capital
Expenditure, or CapEx, model) toward contracting third parties to simply
deliver those services (an Operating Expenditure, or OpEx, model). Why
buy the server and store it onsite when you can rent it offsite at a
lower total cost of ownership? This represents a significantly different
model than the resource-intensive, on-premise models that have dominated
the IT industry for years.

Hosting companies and colocation facilities have provided different
flavors of dedicated hosting services for some time now, but it is only
recently that we have seen the emergence of a true utility computing
model, now known as the Cloud, begin to gain traction. The reasons for
the switch are many. Cloud computing boasts a cheaper, faster and more
efficient approach to running web-based applications than traditional IT
computing. However, those who use cloud computing must understand cloud
architecture and enhancing technologies like application acceleration
and content delivery networks in order to mitigate certain network
limitations. Still, many are finding that the investment required to
navigate this learning curve is minimal when compared to the lengthy
list of cloud benefits.]

#### Types of cloud computing

The industry has appropriated the term “Cloud” to span many different
hosting and even internal virtualization solutions. For our purposes, we
will use the following terminology:

- **The Cloud** – often known as the “Public Cloud,” an off-premise (hosted),
multi-tenant solution that enables a true utility computing model (
[See Rackspace Cloud Solutions](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/))
- **Private Cloud** – single-tenant virtualization solutions hosted either on-
or off-premise ([See Rackspace Private Cloud Solutions](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/private_cloud/index.php))
- **Dedicated Hosting** – both virtualized and un-virtualized single-tenant
computing solutions hosted off-premise (
[See Rackspace Dedicated Solutions](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/index.php))
- **Hybrid Hosting** – a mix of the Cloud and dedicated hosting/private cloud
in a solution ([See Rackspace Hybrid Solutions](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions.php))

Each of these solutions and their hybrid mixture has its own advantages
and limitations, making different solutions more appropriate for
different use cases.

The Cloud is essentially software-powered hardware. It is a pool of
virtualized hardware controlled by software that provides users the
ability to provision and decommission resources within a matter of
seconds or minutes. Obviously, this approach offers the most leverage
and greatest flexibility to enterprises. in this model, the Cloud
service provider owns all of the physical infrastructure and assets, and
allows enterprises to purchase access to these resources, billing only
for time, bandwidth and storage.

The private cloud is a solution in which a single entity hosts
resources in a virtualized environment for exclusive use of its own
organization. This makes it easier to address security, privacy,
compliance and other risks associated with using multi-tenant, shared
resources but requires significant up-front and ongoing investment by
the private cloud consumer. Private clouds are often built in dedicated
hosting environments where a hosting provider provides a dedicated pool
of infrastructure with a virtualization application that allows the user
to quickly provision new virtual machines on the existing pool of
resources.

Hybrid hosting uses a secure private network to connect an enterprise’s
dedicated servers to its more flexible resources in the Cloud. This can
provide the elasticity of cloud computing along with security of
dedicated servers, providing the ability to further optimize the use of
computing resources, even within a single application.

### Considering the cloud

The first question an enterprise should ask when considering cloud
computing is “Why should we use the Cloud?” There are three answers that
consistently arise as the most compelling reasons: speed, agility and
cost. The Cloud provides resources in a matter of seconds or minutes, as
compared to days, weeks or longer for physical infrastructure
expansions. Also, the Cloud removes the limitations of physical
platforms, in that it can theoretically scale infinitely. And the
Cloud’s utility model allows the enterprise to pay for only the
resources it uses instead of absorbing the sunk cost of physical
hardware in the traditional computing model. These significant benefits
tempt many to move quickly into the Cloud, but while the Cloud is for
everyone, it is not for everything.

<img src="{% asset_path cloud-overview/consideration-for-the-cloud-the-process-every-enterprise-should-think-through/considerationimage3.png %}" width="458" height="327" />

This brings us to our next question: “Where should an enterprise use
the Cloud?” The Cloud makes the most sense for web-based sites and
applications. Websites, especially those prone to spikes in traffic and
demand, are prime candidates for the Cloud. as for applications, the
Cloud is ideal for most of them. But some regulatory bodies have yet to
allow for the Cloud, so applications that require special security
accommodations such as payment card industry (PCI) compliance cannot
currently run on the Cloud. Legacy applications or form factors are also
not ideal for Cloud implementation. Aside from these, all enterprise
applications represent ripe opportunities for Cloud adoption, and many
of these applications can still benefit from some hybrid implementation
of the Cloud and dedicated hosting.

### Applying the cloud to applications

Because the Cloud is for everyone but not for everything, it is
important to understand its most appropriate uses. Some businesses use
dedicated hosting to run databases on dedicated hardware for PCI
compliance or because they do not want sensitive data residing on a
shared platform. Other applications – for example, web servers and
certain SaaS tools – run well in the Cloud because of its elasticity and
ability to rapidly scale. The brief, but critical, assessment outlined
below can help decision makers quickly determine whether the Cloud is
right for a given application. That way, time, resources, money and
liability are not invested in an enterprise endeavor that does not
provide optimal value.

**To begin, assess the application itself:**

- Is the workload I/O intensive?
- Is it latency-sensitive?
- Does it require special treatment for security compliance?
- Is it a legacy, proprietary application or form factor?

If the answer to all of these questions is “no,” the Cloud will likely
be a value-added option for an enterprise’s IT strategy.

However, if the answer to any of the questions above is “yes,” an
implementation structured solely on today’s Cloud is probably not
practical. But this should not rule out the use of the Cloud completely,
since [Hybrid hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/)
allows the use of the Cloud where it offers value while leveraging a dedicated
hosting environment where the Cloud is not a candidate. A common example
of such a situation is an application that needs a secure database on
the backend but does not need security at the edge. In this case, the
database is hosted in a dedicated, managed environment and the
less-sensitive portions of the application may be automatically
dispersed among servers in the Cloud. This hybrid approach allows the
enterprise the ability to scale to meet demand from spikes in traffic.

Alternatively, a similar application to the above could run entirely
within a dedicated hosting environment with the ability to “burst” into
the Cloud. This burst functionality allows users to more fully utilize
dedicated resources without concern for performance degradation during a
spike in demand. Otherwise, the enterprise would have to invest
infrastructure to support peak edge capacity, only to have that capacity
stranded and unutilized most of the time.

Every enterprise application has specific traits that make the Cloud
decision a thoughtful one. Some will be able to utilize the Cloud
immediately, while others will take some time to reach a hybrid cloud
solution. in either case, the Cloud should rarely be dismissed as
unfeasible without qualified assessment and consideration for possible
solutions. This initial investment of time and energy can provide
lasting returns by easing the challenges that many enterprise IT
environments must overcome.

### Picking a cloud platform

Once applications have been identified as Cloud-viable, the next step
for an enterprise is to consider which cloud platform to engage. Even
though the Cloud seems like the ultimate platform for flexibility,
making the wrong decision for an enterprise’s Cloud platform can
restrict the intended agility. Clearly it is not the Cloud itself that
hampers flexibility, but rather the proprietary, closed platforms that
some providers offer.

**Here are some important qualities to consider in a platform provider:**

- What kind of customer service and response time do they guarantee?
- How flexible are their service level agreements (SLA)?
- Is their platform an open-source one or a proprietary, closed one?
- Do they bill a fixed or variable cost for capacity?
- What are the technical specifications that they support?
- Do they offer both dedicated hosting and cloud computing solutions under one
roof?

Though enticed by the appearance and assurance of flexibility up-front,
enterprises may find themselves locked into systems that reduce their
computing options instead of expand them. So it is vital for every
enterprise to recognize that not all cloud computing offerings are equal and
to pursue a platform that will allow flexibility in the short and long term.

### Summary

The Cloud concept can potentially solve the challenges of slowness,
overburdened resources and expensive costs that many enterprises are
dealing with in their IT environments. Among cloud solutions, the Cloud,
dedicated hosting/private cloud and hybrid hosting each provide viable
options that can meet varying needs appropriately. To decide among these
three, each enterprise should consider latency, security and legacy
hurdles. Finally, if an enterprise deems cloud computing to provide true
speed, resource and cost advantages, it should select a cloud platform
that will not hinder the largest benefit of the cloud concept: flexibility.
