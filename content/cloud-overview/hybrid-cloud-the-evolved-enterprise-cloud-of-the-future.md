### Introduction

With the benefits of cloud undeniable, enterprises are moving more
aggressively toward growing cloud investments. Many startups and SMBs
have had the benefit of beginning their IT journey in the cloud era,
making adoption of new cloud technologies a standard part of their
long-term IT strategy. However, the cloud journey for an enterprise
opens up an array of issues – from re-architecting existing applications
to protecting massive stores of sensitive data, while maintaining
compliance and security mandates.

The cloud is a different IT model that comes with incredible opportunity
along with new threats and limitations. While the benefits of public
cloud have been proven for certain workloads and use cases (i.e.
startups, test & development, handling burst traffic, etc), there is
growing acknowledgement of its tradeoffs in areas like performance,
customization and security. Therefore, it isn’t realistic to expect that
the future is all-cloud, for all applications.
The fundamental problem is that organizations betting on a cloud-only
strategy are starting with a specific technology as the answer for every
problem. It is like the old adage ‘for someone with a hammer, everything
looks like a nail’. While most organizations are likely to have nails,
some have screws. Research shows that 77% of enterprises have a
multi-cloud or hybrid cloud approach.<sup>1</sup>

Applications and workloads have different and often complex demands.
[Hybrid cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/) is meeting the
need for cloud-powered enterprise architectures that can satisfy the
need for speed and performance without sacrificing security or control.

### Defining Hybrid Cloud

After finding success with workloads like test & development
environments, websites and collaboration, enterprises are eager to adopt
a [service provider
mentality](http://www.slideshare.net/rackspace/enterprise-cloud-forum-adopting-a-service-provider-mentality-16011261)
and take advantage of the benefits of cloud across more workloads.

In the zeal to push to the cloud, some organizations are finding that
not every use case is right for public cloud. The idea of becoming an
all-public cloud shop, while an attractive theory, is simply unrealistic
for many multi-faceted enterprise IT configurations. Adding in cloud
elements may provide isolated benefits for certain apps or workloads,
but can also create security issues, overly complex architectures and
higher total cost for other workloads if improperly architected.

Hybrid cloud offers a more holistic approach where [public
cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public), [private
cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/) and [dedicated
servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/)
(including virtualization) are combined, working together as one
platform to minimize tradeoffs and get the maximum value and
effectiveness of each component of a workload. In the hybrid paradigm,
systems live where they make the most sense – on-premise or hosted,
running on bare metal or virtualized, in dedicated or cloud. Enterprises
have different sets of requirements for different types of applications,
and hybrid cloud solutions offer the flexibility to meet these needs.\

For mission-critical applications, including line-of-business and
proprietary applications, governance and security requirements may point
to the need for dedicated hosting. Usage associated with promotional
events and campaigns, or any application that experiences highly
variable traffic and usage patterns, may be better suited to scalable
cloud solutions. The nature of some applications and the licensing model
might also result in different benefits of vertical versus horizontal
scaling.

Most applications evolve over time. The application itself evolves, the
business and/or the business requirements change, the scale and
complexity might change. With a hybrid cloud, businesses have the
ability to switch between dedicated resources, to choose public or
private cloud services, or use several simultaneously as the needs of
the application change.

Technology is evolving at a pace that makes it difficult to predict the
future. Most people would not have predicted the impact of cloud
computing five years ago. It is impossible to predict with precision how
technology platforms will evolve in the next five years. Rather than
making a commitment to just one model for the long term, hybrid cloud
gives businesses access to multiple platforms, and the peace of mind
that these platforms can meet the business needs of tomorrow.

### Reasons Hybrid Cloud is the Best Fit for Enterprise

Hybrid enables businesses to find the right combination of cloud and
existing resources to do the job. “Hybrid is the end-state. A lot of
people say ‘the end state is cloud’ I don’t buy that at all... It is
about creating the right architecture to support the application and the
evolution of the application over time,” says James Staten, Forrester VP
& Principal Analyst<sup>2</sup>. Mixing and matching infrastructure components
allows enterprises to create a cloud strategy around their unique needs
instead of building around the components of a single provider or
platform. How does hybrid cloud computing serve enterprise IT strategy?

-   **Improves TCO:** By connecting dedicated or on-premise resources to cloud
components, IT can weave cloud efficiencies into existing IT investments that
aren’t ready for cloud to boost performance, maintain security, and enhance
reliability while reducing the total cost of ownership. Though it offers a lower
cost entry point, public cloud alone is often not the most cost effective
solution at scale.

-   **Gradual Cloud Adoption:** Making the most of public cloud often requires
understanding new paradigms and new terminology, re-architecting applications,
and writing code to allow applications to control resources via APIs to provide
scalability and resiliency. Hybrid cloud, on the other side, allows customers to
start by taking advantage of dedicated servers and virtualization using existing
applications and paradigms, and eventually evolve the application by moving the
right elements to a public cloud over time as needed. The flexibility of moving
certain workloads or components of an application between platforms gives IT
shops the ability to transition to cloud at their own pace and only with the
components that make sense.

-   **Enables Innovation:** Hybrid cloud brings all the benefits of the public
cloud: access to massive public cloud resources to test out new capabilities and
try out new technologies without investments that hang around strangling floor
space and budget. Developers can focus on developing instead of provisioning.
With ready-made compute power at your fingertips and fully integrated into your
existing infrastructure, new system enhancements or application updates get
through the software lifecycle faster, and you get your products to market
faster.

-   **Security and Compliance:** Combining dedicated and cloud resources,
enterprises can more easily address many of the security and compliance concerns
of a fully cloud-based solution. An application that requires PCI-DSS compliance
and strict audits, for example, can place secure data on dedicated physical
servers and data- bases isolated from other portions of the website, while the
product catalog can reside on cloud servers for responsive scaling under
fluctuating traffic patterns.
