### Introduction

More enterprises are moving applications to the cloud every day, seeking
faster implementation, more flexibility, and lower cost. But not
everyone has a master plan; these decisions are sometimes made on the
fly with little forethought.

To help you succeed, this white paper presents a step-by-step guide to
moving to the cloud.

These 10 steps cover:

- Discovery and Needs Analysis
- Internal Consensus-Building
- Key Technology Decisions
- Vendor Selection
- An Initial Trial
- Ongoing Rollouts

These steps will help you avoid the most common pitfalls and gain the
best possible ROI from moving to the cloud.

### Step 1: Take inventory of all enterprise-wide apps

The first step is to create a master list of all the software in broad
use across your enterprise today. While it is probably not feasible to
identify every single application in use, a high-level inventory should
help identify areas of greatest opportunity. This list may well cover
hundreds of different apps and utilities depending on the size of your
enterprise.

Once you have identified areas of opportunity, you can take a deep dive
into specific parts of your business. You can start by looking at your
software licenses. Then, quiz the appropriate department, team or
location to unearth all the utilities, databases and websites you may
not even know about.

To help record your research, a sample table is shown below. In Step 1,
fill in columns 1 through 3 to show the name of each app, its purpose,
and the team using it.

### Step 2: Analyze security, peak growth, and expected demand

Are there any special requirements for security or compliance for any
app? How much growth do managers expect to see for each app over the
next three years? About one hardware refresh cycle? Are there any
predictable or recurring peaks in demand? Fill in the answers in columns
4 and 5.

### Step 3: Choose which apps can go on a cloud

Today, the cloud is for everyone, but not everything. In the future, we
expect the cloud to be able to handle nearly any workload, but it is
important to assess application requirements for the current and future
states of the cloud.

Now review your list to see which apps belong in the cloud. Applications
with lower security compliance requirements and demand fluctuation
may be great candidates for the public cloud. “Mainstream businesses
might consider putting product catalogs, marketing campaign fulfillment,
product launch materials, customer self-help services, and low-risk
operations such as inventory tracking and project management applications
in the public cloud,” suggests InformationWeek.<sup>1</sup> However,
the usefulness of the cloud is not limited to these applications. With
nominal effort, solutions can be designed to handle sensitive
information on more secure, dedicated hardware while leveraging the
public cloud for less sensitive parts of the same application. So, the
main attribute to identify applications that will benefit from the cloud
is cyclical demand.

If you’re not sure about future growth or demand, it may be best to rely
on the elasticity of the cloud. But remember that legacy apps written
years ago may not be compatible with the cloud. Fill in the best answer
in column 6: now, later or never.

### Step 4: Decide what types of clouds you need

For each app you want to move, decide which type of cloud it needs:
public, private or hybrid.

A “cloud” is essentially a pool of virtualized hardware that enables
software apps to add and release resources as needed on the fly.

**3 Types of Clouds: **

**Public cloud:**
An off-premises multi-tenant solution that enables a utility computing
model. Example: a website hosted by a third party that can scale up or
down to match fluctuating demand.

**Private cloud:**
A secure single-tenant solution hosted either on- or off-premises.
Example: a customer database running on a set of virtualized servers
behind a firewall.

**Hybrid:**
Two or more clouds connected to support load balancing or cloud bursting
between dedicated in-house resources and virtualized resources in the
public cloud.

For Example: A marketing portal hosted by a third party connected to an
on-premises customer database. The website needs little security, while the
database needs a dedicated environment. When demand increases, the website can
scale up by adding servers in the public cloud; meanwhile, the database
remains secure in its private cloud.

“Take a look at each workload to determine which kind of cloud it should
be in. By asking the right questions around criteria such as
availability, security and cost, the answers will push the workload to
the public or private cloud,” suggests a recent e-book from CIO.<sup>2</sup>

### Step 5: Compare and confirm goals

Stakeholders must reach a consensus on their goals in moving to the
cloud. For example, the CEO may want new apps to improve customer
satisfaction and grow sales. Most CFOs want to contain costs to build
profits. Marketing wants to engage customers and build market share.
While IT must do more with less, the CIO wants to protect his team from
major cuts.

Review all the new apps coming online and the expected growth from
existing apps. If your data center can’t handle the load or you have
difficulty quickly deploying new infrastructure, your enterprise needs
to find a way to support those apps without investing vast sums in new
capital expenses. That likely means finding a cloud partner.

### Step 6: Research prospective hosts

Draw up a shortlist of possible cloud partners and share your goals with
each one. Ask each one for a proposal.

For example, you can hold a conference call or Webex with Rackspace
specialists, including an account executive and sales engineers
specializing in the technologies you need. The Rackspace team will
confirm your needs and deliver a clear and concise proposal.

(You don’t have to wait until Step #6 to speak to Rackspace; we have a
team of specialists that would love to help you through this entire
process from Step #1 on.)

### Step 7: Do due diligence on prospective partners

Compare written proposals and perform due diligence on all prospective
partners. Read customer case studies and check references. Set up a site visit
to see first-hand how each vendor handles physical security and meets
compliance regulations.

### Step 8: Pick the best partner

Accept the best proposal and pick the best vendor to partner with. Sign
an appropriate contract and get ready to work together.

What to look for in an Ideal Cloud Partner:
- Flexible solutions
- No vendor lock-in to cloud architecture, tools or hosting
- Ability to plan and architect public, private or hybrid clouds
- Robust networking with advanced load balancers and application
delivery controllers
- Value-added services like IT planning available
- Dedicated team available to support you 24/7/365
- Online dashboard updated in real-time with all relevant specs
- Support for all industry-standard configurations including Windows,
Linux, x-86 hardware, NetApp, EMC and Dell storage
- Thousands of happy customers with extremely high retention rate

### Step 9: Roll out and evaluate trial

Most companies try out one app for an initial trial period, such as 30
days. Work with your new partner to deploy your trial app in the cloud.
Evaluate the performance using your choice of metrics. Watch how long it
takes to process transactions, add new servers or new users. At the end
of the trial, assess how well the cloud matches your needs.

### Step 10: Deploy and monitor further apps

If the trial was a success, decide which app to roll out next. Your
partner should provide a suitable way to monitor your cloud apps.

For example, Rackspace provides an online dashboard you can use 24/7/365
to review all key metrics. Your Rackspace team will continuously tweak
your cloud apps for best performance and schedule regular reviews every
month, every quarter or as requested.

Repeat steps #9 and #10 as many times as needed.

### Conclusions

These steps will help your enterprise make a sensible plan for moving
your apps to the cloud. If you’d like to hear from the author, please
