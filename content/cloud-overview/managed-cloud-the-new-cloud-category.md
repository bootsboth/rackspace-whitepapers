Instant capacity, cost savings, and an easier way to manage
applications—that was the promise of the cloud. But businesses are
beginning to realize that in order to tap into the cloud’s real business
value, they need to dedicate a growing amount of time and resources to
managing complex, interconnected deployments.

In 2014, Gartner added a new category in its Magic Quadrant Analysis:
[Cloud-Enabled Managed
Hosting](http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-1XH78YH&ct=140715&st=sb).
Managed cloud gives businesses the technology and the expertise to run
it successfully.

This new cloud category succeeds where traditional cloud has failed. By
giving businesses the tools to merge cloud delivery methods with
traditional managed hosting expectations, businesses are liberated from
less strategic, day-to-day management tasks and freed up to focus on
core business objectives. The results are increased efficiency, better
insights and faster innovation.

### 1. Why “Commodity Clouds” Don’t Meet Business Needs

In a climate of rapid cloud adoption, many businesses adopted the cloud
without the foundation, planning and cloud engineers needed to manage
its complexity. In order to keep costs attractive, commodity cloud
providers didn’t offer the support businesses needed to grow their cloud
environments in a responsible, efficient way. While curing some IT
headaches, it created new ones, like:

-   Unreliability: The use of cheap, failure-prone commodity hardware means
over-provisioning cloud resources to plan for server failure.
-   Management: The need to hire experienced cloud engineers to tweak and tune
cloud resources, handle monitoring and alert response, and manage the
applications and workloads running on top of cloud resources.
-   Cloud sprawl: The need for multiple providers to run workloads, secure
deployments and other cloud-related tasks. This leads to shadow IT, platform
lock-in, billing confusion and service compatibility glitches.

### 2. The Solution: Managed Cloud

Managed cloud is a white-glove service for businesses that have moved
past basic cloud into complex, multiple deployments with critical
dependencies and advanced platform requirements. The struggles
businesses faced with commodity clouds are alleviated by:

-   Streamlining providers with a single point of contact to manage the entire
environment, not just a piece of it.
-   Trading out low-value cloud management chores to free up IT resources to
work on high-value technology projects instead of keeping the lights on.
-   Enhancing business alignment by collaborating with IT to achieve business
goals to move toward more automated, policy-driven practices as opposed to just
adding server capacity.
-   Solving talent acquisition with concentrated cloud stack expertise to manage
and guide growth, a key failing of unmanaged clouds.

This model allows IT teams to partner with a provider to get both the
raw compute power and the expertise required to best serve business
outcomes.

#### Rethinking total cost of ownership on the managed cloud

Traditionally, organizations focus on total cost of ownership (TCO) when
making IT decisions. The bottom line cost savings of deploying in the
cloud is usually enough to sell most businesses. And while discussing
the less tangible value of the cloud is more difficult, this is often
where the most meaningful impact is revealed.

How do you put a price tag on time to market? Freeing up time for
experimentation and innovation? Or deepening your current IT staff’s
skills rather than hiring more personnel?

These benefits often trump the bare costs or savings involved with
embracing the cloud. The hidden value of cloud adoption include:

**Competitive Advantage**

A managed cloud approach enables the business to spend time on the type
of strategic work that moves the needle instead of just maintaining
baseline operations. Online retailers, for example, can use performance
data, load time statistics and the impact of improved search rankings to
justify customer experience improvements using a [managed ecommerce
platform](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/). Any move to a
robust, managed cloud platform holds the potential to boost online
satisfaction directly. Meanwhile, moving up in search rankings
translates directly to more qualified leads and sales activity.

**Time to Market**

Time to market is often hampered by resource constraints that prevent
completing a project on budget and on schedule. David Wills, General
Manager of Platform Services at
[Xero](http://stories.rackspace.com/customers/xero/), slashed hosting
costs by 40 percent using the managed cloud. But Wills says the biggest
benefit of the managed cloud is that Xero, “can spin up environments
within 15 minutes now whereas previously it used take us over an hour.”
Wills credits the ability to deploy hardware faster with the managed
cloud as a key factor in getting Xero’s new features to market faster.
Managed cloud can save time and cost in procuring, testing and deploying
cloud infrastructure.

**Adaptability**

By encouraging experimentation, organizations gain the freedom to
investigate new directions with minimal risk. One of the biggest
impediments to innovation in many businesses is simply finding time for
IT to plan and pilot projects along with the hardware and software
resources to run it. The increased flexibility of a managed cloud allows
businesses to quickly react to market shifts while preparing for the
demands of the future. It allows an organization to take a market-leader
role instead of playing catch up. With a managed cloud approach, IT
teams can become more responsive and agile, reducing the chance of
shadow IT and reinforcing the team’s role as a partner to the business.

#### Rethinking security on the managed cloud

More data and higher stakes are adding to the pressure to maintain
bulletproof application security. With the hyper-connected nature of
enterprise environments, single outages can wreak widespread havoc
extending far beyond the IT department. End-user productivity takes a
hit three times harder than IT productivity during an outage. Non-IT/
security departments absorb more than half of DDoS attack-related costs
with customer support bearing 63 percent of the burden.

On-premises hosting has long been thought of as the safest place for
critical applications. However, the [2014 Alert Logic State of
Application Security
Report](/how-to/alert-logic-cloud-security-report-spring-2014-research-on-the-evolving-state-of-cloud)
paints a different picture with cloud-hosted environments proving safer
against these common application threats:

<img src="{% asset_path cloud-overview/managed-cloud-the-new-cloud-category/NewCloudCategory.png %}" width="502" height="260" />

Managed cloud takes security to the next level. In the traditional cloud
model, the onus is on the enterprise to implement the correct security
protocols, including regularly patching and updating servers to prevent
a known vulnerability from being exposed. With managed cloud,
enterprises can enjoy all the advantages of controlling cloud servers,
but also rely on a group of experts that can help ensure the systems are
patched with the latest security releases. Security experts review
hosted environments and systems, then recommend best practices to reduce
vulnerabilities. They review network access control, user access,
cryptographic controls, patching, server hardening and security
software, and then recommend a security solution customized for specific
workloads.

#### Rethinking scaling on the managed cloud

The partnership between a business and a managed cloud vendor is
critical when it comes to scaling. In an ideal world, businesses would
know when a spike in traffic is imminent. But the real world isn’t
perfect, and any social-media mega-platforms can send a torrent of
traffic with little notice while a site is already dealing with a heavy
load.

Managed cloud, and the expert support that comes with it, gives
enterprises the insight to create a scalability plan prior to traffic
spikes. This allows them to leap into action as soon as the load starts
to increase. One part of the team scales the site while another part￼holds
the site together until more resources are applied. A managed
cloud provider can install, configure, manage, troubleshoot and respond
to workload-monitoring technologies that will sound the alarm when
specified threshold parameters are reached.

The managed cloud ensures that scalability can be optmized according to
workload. At
[Inavero](/how-to/inaveros-always-on-platform-built-on-rackspace-hybrid-solution),
a fast-growing survey company in Portland, OR, scalability is key.
“There’s nothing worse than making our clients look bad to their
customers,” said Nathan Goff, Inavero’s operations director. As the
demand for Inavero’s survey app boomed, they needed a compute platform
that could scale with that demand. The company also needed an ultra-
reliable IT infrastructure. Server failure was not an option. And
looking ahead, Goff also knew that as the company’s business grew,
scalability would become even more crucial. For Inavero, growth means
many more instances in which numerous survey campaigns are occurring
simultaneously, making traffic spikes more difficult to predict.

For a way forward, Inavero turned to the Rackspace Managed Cloud. Now
its entire critical compute infrastructure is hosted and managed
externally, ensuring scalability and reliability. In the end, the
technology “really wowed us,” Goff said.

### 3. Putting the Rackspace Managed Cloud to Work

A managed cloud is different from an unmanaged cloud in several
important ways:

-   Leverages hybrid environments that are customized to balance physical and
cloud-based resources for higher performance, enhanced security and cost
efficiency.
-   Provides high-touch support for hardware, application and platform layers so
in-house teams can focus on strategy not maintenance.

At Rackspace, we’ve extended our managed cloud offering to include:

-   Advanced SLA guarantees to give customers confidence in support.
-   Service offerings to support SysOps or DevOps environments.
-   Direct access to engineers and architects.
-   Code assistance to optimize application performance and comprehensive
developer resources via the [developer+program](https://developer.rackspace.com/signup/).

#### Why Rackspace?

In 1998, Rackspace coined the term "managed hosting” which led to a new
industry category. Later, Rackspace became one of the first providers to
market with cloud-based services. Our breadth of experience serving both
massive, enterprise deployments and cloud-savvy, DIY consumers has given
us a unique view into how to serve and support teams. As a result,
Rackspace realigned to serve this evolving business market.

“We’re targeting businesses and developers who want to tap the power of
the cloud without the pain of running everything themselves — and the
expense of recruiting or contracting with experts in dozens of complex
technologies,” Taylor Rhodes, Rackspace President and CEO, shares [in a
blog
post](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/managed-cloud-a-new-way-to-stay-fast-and-lean/).

The Rackspace Managed Cloud solution was positioned the furthest for
completeness of vision and ability to execute in the 2014 [Gartner Magic
Quadrants for Cloud- Enabled Managed Hosting for North America and
Europe](http://www.rackspace.com/about/cloud-enabled/). Our leadership
in the field is further bolstered by the fact that we’re the hosting
partner to six in ten of the Fortune 100, top host to the Internet
Retailer 1000 and co-founders of OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup>.

In describing the Rackspace Managed Cloud, IDC Research Vice President,
Melanie Posey, says, “Rackspace’s managed cloud approach provides an
opportunity for significant differentiation from the rest of the pack.
Rackspace’s new managed cloud strategy featuring enhanced SLAs and its
long track record in delivering superior support will create sustainable
competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded market.”
