### What is the cloud?

You may have heard the term *cloud computing* or *the cloud*, but could
you describe what the cloud is? There are so many definitions flying
around that you wouldn't be alone if you struggled to define it. Therein
lies the problem: the Cloud has all the hallmarks of being a disruptive,
game-changing technology that will revolutionize the way that businesses
operate. But if confusion exists, how can businesses actually reap the
rewards that the Cloud promises?

In a nutshell, cloud computing delivers flexible applications, web
services, and IT infrastructure as a service. The cloud provides those
things over the Internet, using a utility pricing model. It is based on
a computing model that allows businesses to instantly scale their
technology requirements to meet business needs and demand. The cloud is
a cost-effective approach to technology because businesses don't need to
make usage predictions, upfront capital investments, or over-purchase
hardware or software to meet the demands of peak periods.

With the right approach, the cloud can work for organizations of any
size. The industry has seen the highest uptake from start-ups and
tech-savvy developers where there are fewer decision makers. More and
more, however, enterprises are starting to adopt the cloud for different
use cases. Examples of this include:

-   pharmaceutical companies who are using the cloud to gain access to
    computing for the purposes of drug research data analysis
-   online retailers who are using the cloud to meet website traffic
    demands during peak seasons

As you move into any new technology, it is important to understand the
benefits it can provide and the use cases it can support. As with any
technology investment, it is imperative to carefully plan the
implementation of cloud technology to ensure maximum return on
investement. Simple guidelines to follow when planning a transition to
the cloud are outlined below.

### Steps to implementing a cloud

1.  Plan and be realistic
2.  Identify the problem
3.  Choose the right partner
4.  Implement the cloud
5.  The time is now

#### Plan and be realistic

The most important first step when implementing a cloud solution is to
establish a clear and realistic set of goals. Approach the planning
process with patience — don't try to do too much too soon.

Also, you should consult key internal stakeholders at the outset of any
cloud implementation. This includes legal advisors and indemnity
insurers to ensure full protection if a data breach occurs. Other
internal stakeholders, including those who approve technology purchases,
such as the CEO in a small or medium business and the IT Director in a
larger organization, must also be consulted.

#### Identify the problem

Once the objectives have been outlined, take inventory of your
applications, consider which ones should be to be moved first and
identify the in-house expertise available to support the migration. A
thorough assessment of the applications to be migrated to the cloud is
crucial before an investment, with consideration for which applications
are most suited for the cloud and why.

One approach is to determine where you have the most IT pain today and
where you stand to gain the biggest benefit from the cloud. Another
approach is to migrate less-risky applications—those that are not core
to the business or customer facing—first. You may want to start testing
in the cloud with a low risk or legacy application that needs to be
refreshed. This will give your team some low-pressure time to learn more
about working with the cloud.

Implementing a cloud solution does not have to be a complex project.
Complexity, or simplicity for that matter, will be dictated by the
planning that goes into the project prior to start, the chosen cloud
provider's approach to migration and setup, and the type of applications
to be migrated.

#### Choose the right partner

Choosing the right cloud partner is another key component for ensuring a
successful and long-term partnership. Be sure that the cloud provider is
going to support you in the cloud. They should be someone who cares
about your success and will share in both your achievements and your
failures. Other key questions to ask a cloud provider during the
selection process include:

-   How long has the company been offering cloud services?
-   Is the company profitable? If so, for long has the company been
    profitable?
-   Does the company provide a reliable and secure service?
-   What compliance and controls are in place for the service?
-   Does the company provide 24x7 technical support?
-   Are there additional costs associated with the support provided?
-   What is included in the company's technical support?
-   How many support techs are on the support team?
-   What technologies does the company's cloud service support?
-   Does the company have a product roadmap they can share?
-   What is the service level agreement associated with the service?
-   Does the company require a long-term contract to sign up for the
    service?
-   Are there any set-up costs associated with sign up?
-   Are discounts available for high volume usage? If so, at what volume
    levels?
-   Does the company require a minimum monthly spend?
-   Is there a free trial period offered with the service?
-   Does the service enable mobile access?

Exploring a cloud provider's technical documentation can give you early
insight into whether their cloud offering suits your needs. The [Cloud
User's Guide](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/)
is a good place to begin learning about cloud hosting at Rackspace.

#### Implement the Cloud

After you've selected your cloud provider and identified which
application you want to migrate first, it's time to begin your
implementation. Email is usually a good place to start. It is easy to
move from a dedicated email server to cloud-hosted email  because mail
is one of the most painless IT applications to migrate. You can also try
moving your email in the cloud in a phased approach, starting with a
handful of users to pilot the program before getting fully committed.
The cloud is painless to try before you buy because of no long-term
commitment and simple purchasing process.

After the pilot program, reassess how the cloud is working for your
business needs. If everyone is happy with the performance and costs
benefits, it is time to work with your cloud provider and begin a
broader deployment.

Remember to evaluate your needs over time to see where you can gain new
benefits from the cloud. The cloud is not a static technology and, as
such, will continue to evolve and change. Because the cloud
provider-vendor relationships are fluid, you can move to better
technologies without penalty. What is important is to remember that the
cloud is a complement to your current IT investment. It is not an
all-or-nothing solution, but something that can be adopted over time
with careful consideration and planning. Each cloud implementation
should be based on your company's individual IT needs.

#### The Time is Now

The time has never been better to start experimenting with the Cloud.
The tightening economy means businesses have a greater need to get value
for money and this is one of the primary benefits of cloud computing. It
enables businesses to match costs directly to revenues to scale up and
down very quickly. Experimenting now with the cloud will put businesses
in the best possible position to not only survive but flourish.
