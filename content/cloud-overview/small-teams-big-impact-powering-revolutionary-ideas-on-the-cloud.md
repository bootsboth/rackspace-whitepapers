### Executive Summary


With economies all around the world looking for solutions to an
increasingly dire economic situation, we believe that facilitating the
creation of new businesses by individuals and teams with an
entrepreneurial bent is a significant opportunity for growth. We believe
Cloud Computing and some approaches that it enables, is one way to
increase both the speed these startups can move at, and their
opportunity for success. In this paper we focus on different areas Cloud
Computing enables this “startup economy” and give some specific case
studies of startups being built in, and on, the Cloud.

### Introduction

It isn’t hyperbole to say that small businesses are fueling the modern
economy. Small businesses are a massive proportion of business entities
globally and more than ever, startups are rapidly growing to scale and
competing with the largest companies. It has been estimated that 50
million new firms are started every year . And small businesses continue
to be important as they mature; statistics show that in Europe 99.8% of
businesses have fewer than 250 employees .

#### Small Business Punches Above Its Weight in the Broader Economy

Small teams can make a big impact. As shown in the below infographic, the
number of small businesses in the United States is over 1000 times that of
large businesses. Perhaps even more importantly however, the data shows that
small businesses provide between 60% and 80% of new jobs annually – in
difficult economic times it is telling that such a high proportion of
new jobs are created by small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs).

### Number of Businesses in the US

- Large businesses of 1000+ employees: 8,000

- Midsize businesses of 100 to 999 employees: 93,000

- Small businesses of less than 100 employees: 8.1 million  (does not
include home-based businesses) Small businesses in the US...

- represent more than 99% of all employers

- provide 60% to 80% of the net new jobs annually

- are 53% home-based and 3% franchises

- account for 97% of all U.S. exporters of goods

- produce 13 to 14 times more patents per employee than large patenting
firms

### Today’s Startups are Tomorrow’s Big Businesses

One needs to go back a century or so to see how small businesses grow to
scale far more rapidly than ever before in history. In the old world, a
railroad or mining company may have taken many decades to grow to size,
constrained as they were by the need to find significant amounts of
capital to invest in new ventures. Today we have a situation where
technology helps to remove these capital constraints and gives startups
the ability to grow almost without friction, especially high-tech
startups. If we look at the highest value corporations in the United
States, we can see a number that have grown to that position in only a
couple of decades – both Apple and Microsoft, mere infants on the
corporate scale of things are, as of publication of this report, in the
top five US corporations by market capitalization. Apple, depending on
the day, is sometimes the most valuable company in the entire world.

If we look even further and see the valuations that a small clutch of
companies less than a decade old are attracting – one can imagine that
names like DropBox, Box.net and Groupon could well reach that list even
more rapidly.

It is this dramatic increase in the rate of change that is so
transformational. Microsoft was founded during a recession, much like
the one we find ourselves in today. What is different however is that
unlike the 1970’s, today the barriers to entry for a new startup are
greatly reduced as technology becomes so much more accessible. In our
[first white paper](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/revolution-not-evolution-how-cloud-computing-differs-from-traditional-it-and-why-it/),
we pointed out that Cloud Computing democratizes technology saying that:

> Cloud Computing is facilitating a seismic shift in terms of business development.
Formerly entrepreneurs who wished to start a business had to invest significant capital 
into hardware and software licenses. Even the simplest of businesses required expensive 
software licenses, a server or two and the associated administration cost of keeping it 
all running. The availability of Cloud Computing solutions has led to a massive shift in 
the availability of computing power. It is now almost effortless for an entrepreneur to 
set themselves up with some infrastructure and applications upon which to run their 
business.

This democratization gives businesses with little or no capital the
opportunity to test new ideas, kill the ones that don’t fly and rapidly
expand those that do – and in the process build the headline
corporations of the future.

This paper will look at how startups today are using the Cloud to
accelerate their ideas and their companies. And because real-world
experience is the best experience, we will highlight some actual
startups and draw lessons from their experience.

### It All Starts With an Idea

In this environment where technology is increasingly democratized and
homogeneous, it is fresh ideas that build good businesses. Even
technology startups, perfect candidates for entities to focus purely on
technology, generally focus on ideas first. In discussions with
technology entrepreneurs who have managed to execute on their vision, a
recurrent theme is that great startups are about ideas that consume
their founders.

This drive and passion results in an idea being executed upon – but
without that idea and the dedication to realizing it, technology is
irrelevant.

#### Focus on the Idea, Not the Technology Stack

Given the fact that successful businesses are built upon passion for an
idea and not a passion for technology alone, it naturally follows that
entrepreneurs who start with a technology stack and then try and work an
idea are going about things from the wrong direction. We contend that
technology’s fundamental role is to enable solutions to the problems we
are trying to solve – looking at an idea that solves a fundamental
problem, and then deciding what is the best technology to solve that
problem is the best approach.

#### The Value of Lean

Outsourced technology, the availability of freelancers and the reduced
cost of internationalizing a business means that more than ever, a small
team can have a massive impact. While the cliché of a couple of guys in
a garage building a company that can change the world might sound a
little tired, Cloud Computing certainly helps enable this to occur. And
you might not even need the garage. The case studies illustrated later
in this report show that the hard part is coming up with a great,
transformative idea. Once that obstacle is passed, democratized
technology makes it easier than ever before to execute upon that idea.


#### How to Survive Over 7500 Earthquakes with the Cloud: Trineo Case Study

Trineo is a software development business that focusses on custom
solutions using a variety of different technologies. While having a
global customer-base, Trineo is headquartered in Christchurch in the
South island of New Zealand. The founders of Trineo choose to live away
from the epicenter of technology for lifestyle reasons. Over the past
year this choice has been called into question as Christchurch has
suffered over 7500 earthquakes including an event on February 22nd that
decimated the commercial heart of the city.

Over the past year Trineo has been forced to move offices four times as
buildings have been deemed unsafe following earthquakes – throughout the
trying time however Trineo has suffered no issues with regards to
business continuity.

While not every startup needs to think about planning for seismic
events, they do need to think about the potential for business
interruption. The steps that Trineo took both before and after the
earthquakes show the value that Cloud can bring in this important aspect
of running a startup.

Initially the Trineo team worked from various locations in both New
Zealand and Australia. All Trineo’s development happens on various Cloud
platforms and this ensured that no projects or live applications were
affected in any way by the events.

When they first founded the company, Trineo carefully selected the tools
they use internally and chose a wide range of different tools, all of
which are hosted in the Cloud. Trineo makes use of Google Apps, Dropbox,
the Atlassian suite, MinuteDock, Xero, Pivotal Tracker and GitHub. Using
all of these tools ensures that a new laptop can be fully provisioned
and ready to access all the tools a Trineo worker needs within two hours
– all that is needed is a reasonable internet connection.

While earthquakes are hopefully something that no startup encounters in
their journey, given their experience Trineo is very happy they made the
decision to base their business around Cloud tools and applications.

### Failure Isn’t Bad – Embrace It

If one looks at entrepreneurs who have been successful in recent
decades, it is not at all unusual for these people to have previously
been involved in a failed startup. Add to this the number of companies
that succeed after what has come to be termed a “pivot”, and we can see
that failure isn’t necessarily a bad thing per se. Fundamentally,
failure happens, but the key thing is to increase the velocity of
startups so that they can fail fast in the event that their proposition
is flawed.

The benefit of fast failure, especially in a Cloud enabled business, is
that fast failure tends to equate to failing cheaply which results in
the startup being able to turn around and modify their proposition, team
or technology and try again.

#### Cloud Enables Rapid Ideation

Rapid ideation, an approach that sees products and services created
rapidly and iterated quickly and often, is an approach that we believe
gives the best chance of success in a rapidly changing business
environment.

With Cloud Computing, prototypes are inexpensive, the cost of demoing an
application “in the wild” is cheap and applications that aid the rapid
development collaboration are plentiful. Add to this the fact that with
Cloud infrastructure the cost of providing servers is tied to the actual
usage and we can see that Cloud helps companies to maximize their
iteration velocity, while minimizing their cash requirements.


#### How to Increase Business Agility: a Vend Case Study

Vend is a startup that is hoping to revolutionize the way retailers run
their Point of Sale (POS) systems. Rather than being clunky software
that needs infrastructure within the store to run it, Vend is a fully
Cloud-based application that, through the use of smart technology, still
allows retailers to do business if their internet connection fails.

As a SaaS vendor, Vend founder and CEO Vaughan Rowsell decided to
actively “walk the walk” from day one. Vend runs no infrastructure other
than internet connections – with 15 staff spread literally across the
globe – they need to ensure that everybody can work with the same tools
at the same time as to remain agile.

The tools Rowsell has chosen reads like a pick list of Cloud
applications – it includes;

-   Google Apps for all internal email and documentation management
-   Google Sites for internal intranet
-   iChat/Skype for all \\voice and video coms
-   Dropbox for filesharing
-   Tender for helpdesk
-   Chargify for recurring billing
-   Xero for accounting
-   Geckoboard as a business dashboard

Rowsell is very positive about the agility and focus that Cloud tools
have given Vend. He sees the main benefits as:

-   Economic – Vend does not have to spend money on kit and software licenses
-   Speed – Rowsell says that Cloud tools are “Fast to replicate and roll out.
To setup a new hire, we order them a laptop.  All our apps are in the Cloud so
they can get up and running instantly.  And from anywhere”
-   Easier sharing – Rowsell finds that Cloud tools enable him to engage his
investors more readily, he says that “We share KPIs to investors via Geckoboard,
financial information with advisors via Xero and knowledgebase articles with
our reseller partners via Google Sites and Tender”
-   No capital expenditure for technology – Cloud tools are available on a
monthly subscription with no capital outlay. That has been critical for Vend’s
early success. Rowsell explains this saying that “We can pick the best of breed
tools to use for our business without the fear of making a huge capital
investment into something that we may not want or need in 6 months’ time”

An anecdote that Rowsell uses to sum up the value he sees as the CEO of
a rapidly growing startup goes a good way to stating the case plainly.
“One benefit became very clear to me when I spilt a full cup of coffee
over my MacBook.  It was toast, but I just fired up a new machine and
all my critical documents were there, as was my email and all the tools
I need to run the business. Zero downtime.”

Vend is building a world class business, at minimal cost and with
minimal pain – on, in and from the Cloud.

### Cloud – The Platform for Modern Startups

[Recent statistics](http://jpf.github.com/domain-profiler/ycombinator.html)
from the YCombinator startup incubator gave some interesting perspectives
into how startups are structuring their companies. Of the YCombinator
companies, the vast majority use Cloud providers for their hosting and
their email. Anecdotal evidence suggests they also heavily rely on SaaS
for their collaboration and other application needs.

We contend that the reason that very few startups host their own
infrastructure is that startups are, by definition, about unique ideas.
Operating infrastructure is a commodity requirement, much like the
provision of electricity, water or telephone lines. As we pointed out in
[Revolution not Evolution](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/revolution-not-evolution-how-cloud-computing-differs-from-traditional-it-and-why-it/),
in the same way that historically businesses had to provide for their
own requirements in terms of power for machinery, so too did businesses
have to provide their own IT infrastructure.

Many startups don’t consider their infrastructure any differently from
other utilities and as such generally don’t consider taking
responsibility for this side of their business themselves. We contend
that in most instances, to self-host one’s infrastructure simply doesn’t
make sense for a startup that, by definition has a myriad of other more
strategic things to think about. Cloud Computing gives them the
opportunity to let someone else do the worrying for them.

As we detailed in a
[later white paper](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/understanding-the-cloud-computing-stack-saas-paas-iaas/),
the term “Cloud Computing” means different things to different people.

We use a simple acronym to define Cloud Computing. This acronym was
developed by Dave Nielsen, one of the founders of the CloudCamp series
of conferences. This definition sees Cloud Computing described as OSSM
(pronounced “awesome”). This simple concept stands for the following;

-   On-demand: the infrastructure or hardware is already setup and ready to be
deployed
-   Self-service: the customer chooses what they want, when they want it
-   Scalable: customers can choose how much they want and ramp up if necessary
-   Measureable: there’s metering/reporting so you know you are getting what
you pay for

Within this definition lie three distinct different types of services –
Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). We detail the difference between
these three approaches in the
[Understanding Cloud Computing paper](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/understanding-the-cloud-computing-stack-saas-paas-iaas/).
Startups have the ability to leverage all of these different parts of
Cloud Computing – using for example Cloud based email, collaborative
development platforms and Cloud-based infrastructure for their
application or website.

#### How to Automate Repetitive Tasks So You Can Focus on Your Passion: Minute Dock Case Study

MinuteDock is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product running entirely on
Cloud hosting. One of the biggest competitive advantages that MinuteDock
can leverage as a small provider is agility and the ability to quickly
develop, test, and deploy new application features without sacrificing
quality.   

In order to do so, MinuteDock needed a way to quickly provision a new
application environment for the purposes of Quality Assurance testing
before pushing features to customers. This common scenario, otherwise
called a “staging” environment, is sometimes a drag to deploy and
maintain. They also needed to be able to test different development
tracks in parallel without dependencies complicating the testing, to
create a usable link to each environment via a DNS entry, and to bring
down the environments when they were no longer being used.   

A Cloud solution was perfect for this requirement. MinuteDock built a
Configuration Management solution on top of Opscode’s Chef platform, a
comonly used tool to build preconfigured infrastructure configurations.
They then used the included tools to provision and bootstrap new Cloud
servers. MinuteDock then used Rackspace’s DNS API (via the Ruby Fog
Client) in order to create DNS entries for testers to access. The whole
process was again easily reversible via the API.  

The resulting solution allows MinuteDock to create on-demand test
environments via a single shell command, in a cost-effective and
reliable manner using Cloud Servers.  

Another example of Cloud allowing developers to focus on what is really
important, and automate the important, but low value, work.

### Conclusion

Startups represent a significant opportunity for economic growth and may
represent the solution to an increasing economic malaise. In order to
ensure they have the best chance of success, startups need to always
pursue an idea that sees them move fast and stay lean.

Modern development and collaboration approaches, along with an appetite
to “fail fast” are enabled by Cloud Computing in its various shapes and
forms. Thus Cloud Computing is one of the enablers that gives startups
the best opportunity to execute upon their vision.

In an environment where technology is ubiquitous but ideas are rare,
Cloud Computing gives entrepreneurs with smart ideas the best chance to
succeed.
