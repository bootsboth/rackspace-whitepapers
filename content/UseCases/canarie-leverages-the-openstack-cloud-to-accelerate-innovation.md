**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** IT services provider in Alberta, Canada. Not-for-profit, 23 employees

**CHALLENGES:** Work with Canada’s Advanced Research and Innovation
Network<sup>&reg;</sup> (CANARIE<sup>&reg;</sup>) to build a cloud, known as the
Digital Accelerator for Innovation and Research (DAIR), that would help startups
to prototype and demonstrate their ideas online.

**RACKSPACE SOLUTION:** [Rackspace Cloud
Builders](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private_edition/), [OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup>
Compute](http://www.openstack.org/projects/compute/), [OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup> Object
Storage](http://www.openstack.org/projects/storage/), [OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup> Image
Service](http://www.openstack.org/projects/image-service/)

### Non-profit IT services provider uses Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Cloud Builders to help Canadian small and mid-sized businesses drive innovations on the cloud.

[CANARIE](http://canarie.ca/en/home), Canada’s Advanced Research and
Innovation Network, is rapidly embracing cloud computing. And for this
national network, it’s a natural next step. CANARIE has long provided a
dedicated network of high-speed, fiber optic cable that stretches 19,000
km to enable researchers and innovators to collaborate throughout Canada
and around the world. Universities, colleges, hospitals, private and
public sector research labs, and schools across the country depend on
its network. In total, more than 40,000 scientists, researchers, and
educators at more than 1,100 institutions across Canada use resources
provided by CANARIE to improve health, the environment, and the nation’s
economy.

CANARIE issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) to build and deploy a
cloud-based initiative that was to be vital to CANARIE’s efforts in the
years ahead. This project is known as the [Digital Accelerator for
Innovation and Research
(DAIR)](http://www.canarie.ca/en/dair-program/about), an effort that
aims to enable small and medium-sized high-tech companies to create and
scale complex new products online. [Cybera](http://www.cybera.ca/) - a
not-for-profit alliance responsible for advancing cyber infrastructure
in the province of Alberta—partnered with [Compute
Canada](https://computecanada.org/) to offer a compelling response to
the RFP.

“CANARIE wanted to build a cloud that will help entrepreneurs get up and
running with as few barriers as possible,” says Barton Satchwill, senior
developer at Cybera. “It didn’t want these small and mid-sized
businesses to have to buy and build their own hardware and software and
support their own IT infrastructure. It wanted them to be able to start
a virtual machine and go.”

Unfortunately, this journey into [cloud
computing](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/what_is_cloud_computing/)
wasn’t without some significant turbulence.

### Early efforts abandonned: “IT’S NOT US, IT’S YOU.”**

On a separate project, Cybera had experience with a cloud platform that
was popular at the time. “We had a little bit of training and we managed
to get it up and standing. We were making progress. It was slow going,
but it was still progress,” recalls Satchwill. “However, about a year
into the effort, we were having so much trouble keeping the thing going
that we had to start considering alternatives. At the time when we
selected it, it was the front runner and seemed to be doing all the
right things, but it wasn’t working for us.”

“After a year of struggling with it, eventually we had to say, ‘It's not
us, it's you,’" says Satchwill.

Cybera’s development team started to take a close look at what other
platforms might be available, and what new initiatives had taken root in
the previous year. “We’d been following the story about NASA building
its Nebula cloud, and that had piqued our interest,” he says. “It was
then that we took closer notice of
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) and
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/).”

Satchwill and another Cybera developer, Everett Toews, decided to take a trip
to the OpenStack Cactus Design Summit to learn more about the OpenStack project
and Rackspace.

“We were blown away by what we saw. It was in the early days, but we
could tell there was something big underway, in terms of actual working
software, a strong community, and a commitment to open source. We knew
we had a platform we could work with,” he says.

Today, OpenStack is a large-scale open source cloud computing
initiative, founded to drive community-established industry standards,
end cloud lock-in, and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies by
service providers and enterprises. Currently, OpenStack consists of two
core software projects: [OpenStack
Compute](http://www.openstack.org/projects/compute/), [OpenStack Object
Storage](http://www.openstack.org/projects/storage/), and several
sub-projects like [OpenStack Image
Service](http://www.openstack.org/projects/image-service/). These
projects, along with a vibrant ecosystem of technology providers and
future OpenStack projects under way, deliver a pluggable framework and
operating system for public and private clouds.

All OpenStack projects are built through a global collaboration of
developers and cloud computing technologists who are producing the open
standard cloud operating system for both public and private clouds.
Already, cloud service providers, enterprises, and government
organizations around the world are taking advantage of the freely
available, Apache-licensed software to build massively scalable cloud
environments.

To get started, Cybera set up a small test environment that consisted of
a few nodes and virtual machines. “We could see that the system held
potential, but what we built was very basic for what we eventually
needed to do. We figured this would be a good time to take a deep dive
into OpenStack and learn what we needed to support DAIR’s computing
needs,” Satchwill says.

### DAIR cloud lowers barriers to business innovation

That’s when the Cybera development group turned to a team of Rackspace
experts for OpenStack Cloud, the [Rackspace Cloud
Builders](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private_edition/), to see what
support it could provide. “We were looking for practically any training
we could find. It was all so new,” Satchwill says. About a week’s worth
of training was scheduled, and included members of Cybera’s development
team as well as a number of CANARIE partners in the DAIR effort,
including Compute Canada, the University of Alberta, and the University
of Sherbrooke in Quebec.

That training set the stage for the Cybera team to begin its hands-on
development of the cloud that would support CANARIE’s DAIR cloud.“It
took us about a week, working at the University of Alberta, to build
what would become the foundation of the CANARIE private cloud,” says
Satchwill.

That cloud grew to become a multi-region OpenStack cloud deployment that
runs on top of a high-speed university network that spans one region in
Quebec and another in Alberta. Each region currently contains about 20
hosts, each node supporting about 1.5 terabytes of storage per node, and
the cloud is currently capable of handling up to 400 virtual machines.
“Using OpenStack Object Storage, we created three zones to provide us
with triple redundancy,” explains Satchwill.

Today, the DAIR cloud supports dozens of small and mid-sized businesses
that use their new resource to rapidly collaborate and bring their
products and services to market. “The DAIR cloud reduces the barriers to
entry for smaller companies, and it is helping them to understand how
cloud computing can make a difference for them,” explains Robin Winsor,
president and CEO at Cybera. “That’s very important, because we see the
trend toward cloud computing really changing the way people approach how
they get the resources that they need, and reducing the barriers to
entry to make it much easier for them to get involved sooner, rather
than later,” Winsor says.
