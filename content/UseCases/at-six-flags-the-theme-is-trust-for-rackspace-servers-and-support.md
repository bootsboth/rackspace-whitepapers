### Company Overview

Every year, hundreds of millions of families visit Six Flags
Entertainment Corporation’s theme parks in search of value-packed
thrills. But if the company’s website goes down, those thrills are gone.
“Our website, sixflags.com, is a major venue for our ticket and season
pass sales,” explains Sean Andersen, Director, Interactive Services, Six
Flags. “As one of our primary commerce engines, it needs to be highly
available.”

Six Flags has always used an external hosting provider for its website
and e-commerce applications servers. Over time, the company became
dissatisfied with its hosting services vendor. “We weren’t getting the
level of support we needed,” Andersen says. “They were also selling us
adjunct services that we didn’t really need or use.”

Six Flags needed a provider that it could truly trust. That provider
turned out to be Rackspace.

### Availability Critical - Especially During Peak Season

Andersen, who joined Six Flags right after the company moved to
Rackspace, wasn’t surprised that working with the hosting provider was a
pleasure. “I’ve used Rackspace in previous jobs,” he explains. “And in
over ten years, I have never had a negative issue with them. I have
never felt frustrated with them—not once. That is unheard of in a
client-vendor relationship.”

Rackspace took care of sixflags.com from an availability standpoint by
ensuring that its server infrastructure is highly redundant. This is
particularly important during the company’s summer peak season. “We run
promotions to drive traffic to the site,” Andersen says. “With
Rackspace, we can design the services we need on the back end to process
the orders that result, without having to worry about hardware or
operating systems.” Six Flags always knows that, thanks to Rackspace,
its website will be available even during major traffic spikes.

Six Flags uses Rackspace for other portions of its business as well. For
instance, a development environment for the company’s social media
programmers is currently hosted on its own, dedicated Rackspace server
environment. “We use external agencies for this development work,”
Andersen explains. “Rackspace lets us give them an environment
completely separate from the rest of our infrastructure. We always have
complete control over what the programmers can touch.”

### Jumping Ahead of the Competition

Andersen also values the industry expertise Rackspace offers. When Six
Flags became interested in building out an intranet portal to support
its 30,000 seasonal workers, it discovered that Rackspace was already
familiar with the software it wanted to use—Microsoft SharePoint
2010—even though, at the time, the software was not commercially
available. “I was very impressed that Rackspace had anticipated our
needs that way,” Andersen says. “It really demonstrates the fanaticism
of their support, and how they jump ahead of the competition by being
proactive about industry trends.”

Andersen is also pleased that Rackspace offers cloud computing services.
“We’re very interested in how cloud computing could allow us to cut back
on our dedicated environment,” Andersen says. “Because Rackspace has
demonstrated leadership in this area, it helps us with our long-range IT
planning.” Andersen believes that moving to a cloud computing platform,
which would allow Six Flags to scale up or down depending on its website
traffic volume, could ultimately reduce its hosting costs by 30 percent
or more.

Andersen also expects Six Flags to consider Rackspace cloud computing
for specific digital initiatives, such as its dedicated television
network.

### Committed to Customers

Whether it’s tackling current website traffic patterns or planning for
the future, Andersen knows Rackspace delivers the attention and support
he needs. “The quality of Rackspace support is the standard we use for
every other Six Flags vendor,” Andersen says. “Whether the issue is as
simple as a password re-set or as complex as a server outage, Rackspace
is always ready to help. And it doesn’t matter what time of day it is.
It could be three in the afternoon or three in the morning, we can
always reach someone.”

Knowing that Rackspace support is always there, ready to listen to
Andersen’s needs and immediately address any issues that arise, is a
primary reason the company continues to earn Six Flags’ trust. “When you
close out a ticket with Rackspace support, they always ask you to tell
them if their response to your request was satisfactory,” Andersen
notes. “That they are so interested in customer feedback speaks volumes
about their commitment to their customers. They really make us feel like
they appreciate that Six Flags is their customer.”
