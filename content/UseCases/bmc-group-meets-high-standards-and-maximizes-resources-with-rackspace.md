**Stable, highly available infrastructure backed by Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>
frees information management services provider to focus on its core
business**

**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** SaaS document management

**WHAT THEY DO:** Virtual data room: a secure, dedicated web-based
platform where professionals can share documents, streamline workflow,
collaborate with additional partners and prepare data for its ultimate
future use

**CHALLENGES:** To save valuable CapEx while still meeting the market’s
demanding infrastructure requirements.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** A hosted environment that includes a
highly-redundant cluster of [Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> SQL
Server<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/database/mssql/)
and multiple geo-redundant web service farms

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** BMC Group was able to meet rigorous industry
requirements, maintain a fixed monthly cost, and avoid the expense of
hiring additional personnel.

### BMC GROUP, INC. CUSTOMERS NEED: SECURE, COMPLIANT INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES

BMC Group is a privately owned Seattle-based company that provides
information management support services for the legal, financial,
corporate and medical industries. It is recognized for its work in
restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, litigation and medical records
support services with offices throughout North America, Europe and
Asia.

One reason for the company’s success is its understanding of its market.
Equally important, BMC Group knows how to focus strategically on its
core competencies. It relies on Rackspace for IT hosting to help achieve
its core objectives.

### SEEKING HIGH STANDARDS FOR HARDWARE AND SUPPORT

BMC Group first turned to Rackspace as it prepared to launch a new line
of business: providing technology and services for companies planning
mergers and acquisitions. While the company initially considered
building out its server infrastructure in-house, it rejected that plan
when it began calculating costs. “To serve this market, you need to meet
demanding requirements,” notes Jeff Kalina, Executive Vice President
Corporate Services, BMC Group. For instance, the servers must be highly
available and highly secure; they must be regularly refreshed to keep up
with the latest technology.

That can be expensive—not just in terms of capital expenditures as BMC
Group would also need to hire additional staff to manage the new
servers. “First, we’d have to find the right talent,” says Kalina.

“Then we’d have to manage them. And they’d need to be available 24/7.”

So BMC Group decided to consider hosting—and after evaluating several
hosting providers, it chose [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/).
“We’re a technology-enabled company, but managing servers is not our
core business,” Kalina says. “Managing servers is a Rackspace
proficiency. Hiring them meant we’d get the caliber of personnel our
team could work with and would need to build and support this
environment.”

### FIXED MONTHLY COST SIMPLIFIES FORECASTING

After BMC Group made its decision, Rackspace configured an
infrastructure to BMC Group’s specifications. Today, that environment
includes a highly redundant cluster of Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> SQL
Server<sup>&reg;</sup>and multiple web service farms spread across three
primary physical locations—two in the US and one in the United Kingdom. In
addition to supporting the merger and acquisition due diligence business, the
environment is tapped by BMC Group clients worldwide for everything from
contract management, to collaborative document sharing and editing, to
providing highly secure corporate data repositories.

The hosted solution worked so well for BMC Group, Kalina says, that
when the first 3-year contract came up for renewal, BMC Group never
considered switching vendors—it signed a new contract to continue the
relationship. That decision, Kalina adds, is testament to the value
Rackspace delivers to BMC Group. Some of that value is fiscal. “With
[Rackspace Managed Hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/),
we know our fixed monthly costs. It makes forecasting easier,” Kalina
says. BMC Group also knows its infrastructure will always utilize
current technology.

### REDUNDANT ARCHITECTURE FOR SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE

But perhaps more important is the quality of the hardware architecture.
“We know our environment with Rackspace includes the redundancy needed
to withstand everything from run-of-the-mill hardware failures to
natural disasters,” says Kalina.

This is particularly important for BMC Group because its customers place
high value on system security and stability. In fact, many of these
customers review and test the data center configurations, process and
functionality as part of their due diligence before hiring BMC Group.
“They need to make sure the environment is secure and in compliance,”
Kalina notes. The ability to show these customers first-hand that the
systems are configured to the highest standards for business
availability and disaster recovery is a cornerstone of BMC Group’s value
proposition to its customers.

### FANATICAL SUPPORT: “THEY BRANDED IT, THEY LIVE IT.”

Then there is [Rackspace Fanatical<sup>&reg;</sup>
Support](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/). “Our business
is in real time. These sites can not be down,” Kalina says. “We know
with Rackspace, we’ll have support engineers on hand any time we need
them to make system changes or repairs.”

The trust BMC Group placed in Fanatical Support was well worth it,
Kalina adds. “Especially in the early days of the relationship, there
were times when we leaned heavily on Rackspace support. They were always
there for us. They were willing to do whatever it took to get our
systems where they needed to be.”

Kalina views Rackspace’s emphasis on customer service as the foundation
of their corporate culture. “Rackspace is customer-oriented. They truly
are Fanatical. They branded its support, and they live it.”

It’s a quality that fosters more than trust but also inspires
admiration. “What Rackspace has accomplished as a company is
impressive,” Kalina concludes. “It’s a remarkable organization, and we
love being partnered with them.”
