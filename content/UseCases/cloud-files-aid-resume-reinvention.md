**CUSTOMER BUSINESS:** Purzue is a startup dedicated to enabling the creation
of innovative multimedia résumés.

**CHALLENGES:** Purzue needed a worry-free way to handle millions of
user-uploaded images, audio, and videos.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Purzue is free to focus on their core offering.

### Rackspace Cloud Files help Purzue disrupt the hiring process.

Based in Woodbridge, New Jersey, Purzue is a startup dedicated to
disrupting the hiring process. By enabling the creation of innovative
multimedia résumés, the 20-person startup allows users to transcend the
boundaries imposed by traditional résumé formats.

Purzue’s key differentiator is the fact that it allows users to upload
images, audio, and video to tell richer stories about themselves than
would be possible in black-and-white text. Rackspace Cloud Files allows
them to serve millions of media files without worrying about storage or
CDN.

### Making use of Rackspace

Though Purzue is just over a year old, its founders have been
well-acquainted with Rackspace for several years. They were first
introduced to the company while working on their other endeavor, a
talent-competition site called Lafango that planted the seed for
Purzue.

“Lafango had a feature called Electronic Press Kit, press kits that
comedians could upload their videos to and hand out at different venues
to get gigs,” CTO Jamie Aquila explains. “We thought about how we could
capitalize this business model for every user in the world, and we
decided to incorporate some of these multimedia features on the
next-generation résumé.”

Frustration with [dedicated
servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/),
as well as a potential for significant savings, led Lafango to the
cloud. Purzue’s needs were similar. “I can write novels about our
headaches regarding dedicated machines,” Aquila says, “number one being
cost. Purzue and Lafango are heavy in user-generated content, and
storage was an absolute disaster. Numerous times, we had to move
terabytes of storage from one server to another, larger server, which
proved costly in time and bandwidth. Then it was issues with files on
multiple servers: Where are the backups? Which file is on what server?
In what country? Rackspace Cloud Files clearly solved every one of those
issues and then some.”

“Back in the day, we had a regular FTP-based CDN,” Aquila continues. “We
had to worry about storage as well as the connection to the CDN. When we
were introduced to Cloud Files, we thought, ‘Bingo.’ We don’t have to
worry about the storage, and we don’t have to worry about connecting to
the CDN. Cloud Files handles that for us, to the point where we’ve
totally ditched our own storage and our own servers. We rely on
Rackspace for everything.”

Aquila means it when he says everything: in addition to Cloud Files,
Purzue and Lafango make use of a full portfolio of Rackspace products,
including [Cloud Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/),
[Cloud Databases](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/databases/), and [Cloud
Load Balancers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/loadbalancers/).

### Superior and stress-free performance

Thanks to Cloud Files, handling millions of user-uploaded media files is
no longer a hassle. An [open-standards
API](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-files/v1/getting-started/)
allows other applications to communicate directly with Cloud Files, which makes
for a hands-off, automated process. Aquila describes Purzue’s uploading setup:
“When a video gets uploaded, the file hits our web server. We then push
it to a temporary container built on Cloud Files and contact Zencoder
and get a few versions of the file made. They have their own API that
talks to Cloud Files and actually puts the file right back on to our own
Cloud Files system, so we actually don’t have to worry about it.”

Aquila is also impressed with [Akamai CDN on Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/technology/?page=cdn).
“We’ve used multiple CDNs in the past, and Rackspace blows them all out
of the water. And I'm not just talking price per gig or transfer or
on-paper cost. We also talking time: time saved for ease of use, ease of
upload, and, ease of CDN. One click and you're on. That's it. No origins
to worry about, no file-system storage limits, nothing. Complete peace
of mind.”

### Support you can count on

Purzue users count on all of their media being ready to go when
prospective employers take a look at their résumés. Rackspace is
renowned for its reliability, but in the event of a glitch, Aquila knows
[help is a moment away](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/).
“I have never had an issue where Rackspace hasn't responded
immediately,” he says “That cannot be said of other providers,
especially other server providers. We've been around the block in this
area, too: Amazon, Internap, 1&1, and Voxel. Response time is key, and
Rackspace has been the quickest in this aspect.”

Aquila says he recommends Rackspace to colleagues regularly. “It may
sound cheesy, but Rackspace let's me do my job,” he says. “As a CTO of a
growing startup, time is money. If I'm wasting my time with moving
files, building servers, and making sure databases aren't crashing, then
that cuts me out of managing the work that is being done in-house,
improving our product and making it more successful. Rackspace allows us
to worry about our own product instead of worrying about theirs.”
