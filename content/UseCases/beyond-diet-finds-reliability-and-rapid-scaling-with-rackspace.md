### Company Overview

Isabel De Los Rios and Jeff Siegel founded Live Smart Solutions in 2008.
Live Smart is a diet and nutrition company whose core business is a
program to help people lose weight through diet and exercise.

Live Smart has also created a social network called Beyond Diet
(beyonddiet.com), where customers can interact with each other and
support one another as they transition into a healthier way of life. The
company promotes a healthy lifestyle with educational books, videos,
audio, and the site TheDietSolutionProgram.com.

Live Smart saw explosive growth in 2010, with revenue increasing 50
times over the previous year, the company reports. They expect to double
revenue in 2011 and continue along their current growth trajectory. What
was a two-person company has now grown to 20 employees, focused on
teaching the most essential principles for weight loss and disease
prevention.

### High Traffic Numbers Mean Performance is Critical

To handle the traffic that comes to their sites and better support their
end users’ experience, Live Smart’s top priorities were reliability,
support, and flexibility. Live Smart evaluated both dedicated and cloud
solutions in determining how to best support visitors to their website.

In learning about the myriad hosting options available, Cloud Hosting
emerged as the ideal match for their business. “We often get a million
hits a day,” says Rob Volk, Chief Technology Officer at Live Smart and
Beyond Diet. “It’s important that we can elastically scale out our
server farm when we have high traffic, then contract it again.”

A number of factors influenced the decision to choose a cloud solution.
“First was cost,” says Volk. “It’s significantly cheaper to go to the
cloud.” Flexibility was also an important variable. “Going in, we didn’t
know how many servers we’d need, or what configuration we needed. With
dedicated, you lose some flexibility. You’d say what you think you want,
but it’s a real piece of hardware. That can be much more expensive, due
to economies of scale.” Cloud computing’s ability to transition capital
expenditures to operating expenditures helps Live Smart manage their
costs, as well.

### Choosing a Cloud Provider

Before coming to Rackspace, Live Smart was hosted on a different major
cloud platform. “It allowed us to scale easily, but we didn't have root
access to the boxes and deployments could take hours at the time,” says
Volk. “The most disappointing thing about [our previous host] was
their support. We called them because our site was intermittently down
and their tech actually said ‘I'm going to downgrade this from critical
to important.’ We got right off them.”

Volk explored many of the players in the cloud computing landscape,
committed to finding the best offering. “We looked at one of the other
major cloud companies,” he says. “They offered a slightly richer
features set, but their support was really not there. You had to pay a
significant amount of money to get what you get for free at Rackspace.
The Managed Operations [for Cloud Servers] is a whole other level the
other company didn’t even have.”

### Flexibiity on the Cloud: Scaling in Minutes

Live Smart moved their computing to Rackspace in May 2010, and now use
Cloud Servers with Managed Operations, as well as Rackspace Cloud Load
Balancers and Cloud Files. “We chose Rackspace for the support, and also
the service you get: extremely fast configuring and it’s highly
flexible,” says Volk.

The scalability of Cloud Servers has been a big asset for Live Smart.
“We love being able to scale both horizontally and vertically,” says
Volk. "After New Year’s, everyone goes on a diet, so that’s when our
traffic peaks. We might get three times the traffic from January to
March. With Cloud Servers, we’re able to spin up new web front ends
within a matter of minutes, and then take them back down once traffic
goes down. We have this elasticity in our farm that is only possible in
a virtualized environment."

### Cloud Load Balancers Provide Additional Stability and Value

To handle the load, Live Smart had been using two HAProxy load
balancers, running on two small Linux virtual servers. But that
configuration wasn’t perfect. “The virtual servers just went down
sometimes,” says Volk. “We had some reliability issues before, because
it was software-based.”

As soon as Rackspace announced cloud load balancers, Live Smart took
advantage of the beta version. The cloud load balancers have been a
great fit for Live Smart, allowing their sites to adeptly handle the
million hits a day they receive. Live Smart is getting so much traffic
that they wrote their own simple analytics traffic system, which pulls
analytics that they store in Cloud Servers running Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>
SQL Server<sup>&reg;</sup>.

Live Smart is now using ten or so cloud load balancers, one per domain.
All of them are being used for production, as their staging environment
lives on just one server.

Live Smart is also launching sites in French and Spanish, which means
there will be an even bigger traffic load to balance. “The load
balancers are definitely handling a lot, with no issues. They’re scaling
beyond what we can imagine.”

### Rackspace Means Peace of Mind

Why did Live Smart choose Rackspace, amid all their other options?
“Reliability, of course, and then support was our main driver for going
to Rackspace,” says Volk. “We know that we can call anytime and get
someone on the phone.”

[Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)
has made a significant difference in the time and effort Live Smart
expends thinking about servers. “I can definitely relax more,” says
Volk. “We had a part-time sys admin working on the site. It was not the
best option for us. With the launch of Cloud Servers with Managed
Operations, Rackspace is helping with our Linux and Windows support.
They’ll make our changes as we need them, and respond to any issue, 24
hours a day. Within minutes, an engineer will log on to fix the
problem.”
