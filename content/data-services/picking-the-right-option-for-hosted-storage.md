The demand for storage is growing quickly... but choosing the right
technology to support it can be challenging. This white paper helps by
describing the four types of data assets and recommending the best
hosted storage option(s) for each type.

### Demand for Storage is Growing Fast

A recent survey of Oracle User Group members found data growing rapidly
at 90% of their firms. Smaller businesses are not immune. One consultant
advises SMB managers to plan for 800% storage growth over two to three
years.

The demand for storage can grow so quickly it catches IT managers
off-guard. For example, a Forrester survey found that 400 IT
decision-makers around the world predicted a 19% increase in 2007, but
experienced actual growth of 131%; their average data requirements
jumped from 38 to 88 Terrabytes in one year.

### Picking the Right Technology is Vital

Clearly, every business needs storage... but what type? There are
different technologies, and not every IT department knows how to
evaluate every choice.

For example, there is a big difference between user-generated content
and a mission-critical customer database. Storing both with the same
technology can mean costly overkill for one, and underpowered
performance for the other.

A mismatch could even slow down your operations, turn off prospective
buyers, and stifle your company’s growth.

### The Four Types of Data

Consider how business information is classified. Data can be divided
into structured and unstructured, or split into three types: files,
e-mail, and databases. This white paper proposes the four categories of
data assets summed up in Table 1.

1. **The basics** cover all the routine files that any business needs.
These files tend to accumulate at about the same pace the business hires
new employees.

2. **Public assets** cover anything the public is supposed to see. There
is little need for security for these files, since you want them to be
viewed by the outer world. And it’s a great option if any of these go
viral. Public assets tend to accumulate quickly—especially if the
company has an active community of users who generate ongoing blogs,
comments, photos, and videos.

3. **Private assets** cover anything the public is not supposed to see.
That includes any personally identified information (PII): name,
address, SSN, driver’s license, credit cards, and so on. Every business
wants to safeguard transaction records and anything covered under FERPA,
HIPPA, HITECH, or Sarbanes-Oxley, or SEC rules.

Private assets tend to grow at about the same pace as the business. In
other words, as the number of clients, employees, and transactions
grows, so does the volume of private files. These are also subject to
unpredictable spurts.

4. **High-performance assets** include heavy-traffic websites and
mission-critical databases. This is the only category that can overlap
with another.

For example, a large e-commerce site can be considered both a public and
a high-performance asset. If the product line grows and sales explode,
so will these assets. Even if the site’s sales are stable, it could
experience a sudden spike at any time.

### In Storage, One Size Does Not Fit All

Many IT departments are committed to one or two types of storage
technology. The company may have standardized hardware and IT may not
have time to investigate other approaches. But this one-size-fits-all
design can overlook many of today’s choices.

As one commentator says, “single platform shops are becoming as rare as
an ice cube in the Sahara.”

After all, three out of four asset types can grow unpredictably. If all
your assets are stored on a single type of network server with a single
architecture, this can severely limit your flexibility. This is
especially true when you launch a new app, new site, or new database
that falls into a different category of asset. That’s the best time to
consider a wider set of options.

### A Better Solution: Match Technology to the Asset

Many IT departments now use hosted storage to gain better cost,
expandability, and performance... and to match the right technology to
the right asset.

There are many service providers to choose from, beyond the old-line IT
giants. For example, the hosted storage options from Rackspace have been
well received by customers and the industry.

“Rackspace has very quietly outflanked giants Microsoft and Google in
online storage,” declared a recent review on CRN.com. When NetworkWorld
compared five storage vendors including Amazon, “Rackspace delivered the
best overall performance.” And a blogger who ran speed tests found
Rackspace much faster: “After 24 hours of monitoring, the average
response time from Rackspace was 10 times faster than Amazon.”

Rackspace offers a range of storage options, as shown in Table 2. These
options provide for every type of data asset and every budget.

**Internal or Direct-attached Storage**

For any hosted customer, additional hard drives can be plugged into
existing servers at the data center until all the slots are filled. This
builds more storage capacity in a transparent fashion, at a known cost,
and takes care of many SMB needs.

**Cloud Storage**

Many companies are benefitting from the dynamic expandability and low
cost of the cloud. “Cloud storage offers pay-as-you-go, elastic
self-provisioning with low prices per unit storage per unit time, making
costs easy to predict, control, and map to the workload of an
organization’s IT assets,” said a recent white paper from Oracle.

**Rackspace has two options for cloud storage:**

[**Cloud Files**](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/) provides
unlimited storage with high-speed delivery of public assets. An
easy-to-use control panel enables any knowledge worker to upload, store,
and share files. The API can be integrated with web apps for even better
performance. And the Content Delivery Network can cache files on servers
around the world for faster downloads.

[**Cloud Drive**](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/backup_and_collaboration/online_file_storage/)
is for businesses that need to store files, back up PCs, and synchronize
basic assets. This works like any other drive on a computer, but stores
files in the cloud for simple and secure sharing and backup.

[**Shared Storage Area Network (SAN) from EMC **](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/storage/san/)
is for businesses that need shared storage or entry-level
virtualization or clustering, but aren’t sure how much their needs will
grow in the future. In this multi-tenant approach, space on the server
is shared with other businesses. Some limitations are in effect, such as
no support for snapshots or replication.

[**Dedicated SAN from EMC **](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/storage/san/)
is for businesses that need fast, highly secure storage for public/private
and high-performance assets. This SAN provides block-level storage via
fiber channel on a dedicated server that enables snapshots and clones
for easy backup and replication.

[**Dedicated SAN from NetApp**](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/storage/san/)
is for businesses that need fast, highly secure storage for public,
private, and high-performance assets. This SAN provides file-level
storage via network-attached storage; ideal for Web 2.0 and rich media
that requires fast delivery and high availability. Storage optimization
achieved by consolidating multiple versions of the same files
(de-duplication).

### Conclusions

Most data assets are growing in most businesses today, some rapidly. But
storing all assets with the same technology is old-fashioned and
inflexible. It’s better to match the right storage technology to the
appropriate asset.

Hosted storage from a leading provider like Rackspace offers a range of
cost-effective options plus a flexible roadmap to handle both steady
growth in storage and sudden spikes in demand.
