### Introduction

The Apache™ Hadoop<sup>&reg;</sup> open-source software framework allows for
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.
Using simple programming models, Hadoop enables companies to derive
business value from large volumes of unstructured, aggregated data. This
opens up a wide range of cutting-edge use cases, such as fraud detection
and social-media sentiment analysis. However, Hadoop is notoriously
difficult to deploy and requires expensive, hard-to-find expertise.

The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform is an enterprise-ready service
based on the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) for Hadoop. The Rackspace
Managed Big Data Platform offers the powerful benefits of big-data
analysis without the challenges of configuring clusters, maintaining the
platform, or troubleshooting jobs.

Every Hadoop environment is unique, so Rackspace customizes each Managed
Big Data Platform environment to match the precise requirements of
customers’ data initiatives. Solutions come with all application
components installed and optimized, and Rackspace offers multiple
reference architectures and storage mechanisms based on industry best
practices. This helps to create an optimal fit for customer-query
performance.

By combining a purpose-built platform with support for Hadoop, the
Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform provides:

1.  Managed platform for Hadoop

2.  Optimized performance

3.  Flexibility

The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform is backed by Rackspace’s unique
**Fanatical Support** <sup>&reg;</sup>. That means that our experienced Hadoop
specialists are available 24x7x365 to patch, maintain and troubleshoot
your environment.

The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform is ideal for customers seeking
all the benefits of big data without the hassles of managing and
maintaining Hadoop clusters. The service is designed to help businesses
planning to use Hadoop in the near future, and businesses that have
already tried and struggled to use it successfully.


### The challenges of managing Hadoop


The ability of Hadoop to efficiently store and process large, diverse
data sets is attractive to business leaders trying to make informed,
data-driven decisions. Companies that attempt to deploy Hadoop on their
own, however, face several daunting challenges.

#### Updates create vicious cycle

Hadoop is unusual. As a distributed system, it requires extensive
management and offers no centralized storage. Experienced architecture
experts are hard to find, and their expertise is short-lived because the
technology evolves so fast each point release adds new tools and brings
notable changes to the architecture. Together, these complexities create
a cycle of chronic challenges. Even if businesses can find experts, they
may reach the end of a months-long procurement process only to discover
that the architecture of Hadoop has already changed. That sends
architects back to the drawing board and leaves companies far behind
schedule.

#### Hadoop security is limited

Enterprise deployments of Hadoop have long been hampered by the lack of
default security solutions and the difficulty of maintaining affordable,
compliance-grade protections. Open-source projects have helped improve
the out-of-the-box security of Hadoop, but businesses still need to add
layers of protection to adequately monitor and safeguard valuable
customer data.

#### Capital and operating costs can be prohibitive

Implementing and managing a big-data solution based on Hadoop can be
extremely expensive. The hardware required to meet big data demands is a
major investment for enterprises that do not have access to large
volumes of commodity machines. And then there are the often-overlooked
operational costs of Hadoop. Leveraging Hadoop frequently requires
businesses to re-train existing staff and hire new employees to monitor
and maintain the system.

#### Non-optimized hardware causes delays

Running Hadoop on non-optimized hardware can yield slower queries,
leaving end users with sluggish visibility into the data that they need
to make better decisions and build profitable solutions. As Hadoop
evolves to address new streaming and interactive workloads, query
performance variations of even a couple of seconds will make or break
the end-user experience.


### Managed Hadoop

The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform can greatly simplify the process
of implementing, optimizing, and maintaining Hadoop, which allows
customers to fully focus on deriving insights from their data; IT
resources can be reallocated to initiatives that differentiate the
business and build a competitive advantage.

Rackspace handles management throughout the Hadoop life cycle of design,
configuration, deployment and maintenance, so internal teams don’t have
to. Rackspace works directly with Hortonworks, so customers have a
single point of contact. Experts from both companies maintain
single-pane visibility into the infrastructure and platform/application
layers, sparing customers the multi-vendor complexity that often arises
when infrastructure and platform providers interact. This helps
customers get the answers they need in less time. Customers get the
combination of infrastructure expertise and Hadoop application expertise
that is critical to maintaining a healthy environment.

Rackspace stands behind every part of the service with Fanatical
Support. Rackspace support staff and engineers are available 24x7x365
for everything from architecture design to query optimization.

intelligence and analytics applications out of the box. The Rackspace
Managed Big Data Platform supports the technology application partners
Hortonworks.

#### Commitment to open source

The Managed Big Data Platform is built on core open-source technology,
not a proprietary version. Hortonworks is similarly committed to driving
innovation in the open-source community, and is the only provider that
works entirely within the Apache Software Foundation process. By relying
on the OpenStack® cloud from Rackspace and the Hadoop platform from
Hortonworks, businesses can take advantage of flexible and convenient
data portability.

#### Breadth and depth of tools and integrations

The Hortonworks Data Platform includes all core Hadoop tools, and
Hortonworks and Rackspace will continue to keep pace with the rapidly
expanding Hadoop ecosystem.

Big data applications power a wide range of applications and platforms.
The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform environment comes ready to
integrate with business intelligence and analytics applications or
primary data stores. For example, Rackspace offers a MongoDB file-system
connector and affordable object-storage platforms like Rackspace Cloud
Files. Users can also deploy on traditional bare metal or other
supported storage options, such as EMC Isilon or OpenStack Object
Storage (swift).

Developers can deploy and leverage Spark for real-time data processing,
including the ability to rapidly write applications using Java, Scala,
or Python. Spark can also be used interactively from the Scala and
Python shells.


### Companies with security and compliance requirements

Single-tenant solutions are inherently more secure than multi-tenant
solutions, and they are highly customizable to help companies implement
security features and manage access requirements.

As part of the Rackspace Big Data Managed Platform service, Rackspace
can combine customers’ Hadoop clusters with available appliances and
services from an extensive security portfolio that customers can
purchase to help them address their compliance needs. The Rackspace
portfolio includes intrusion detection, log management, web application

### Use cases


The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform uses the popular Hortonworks
Data Platform to help businesses address a variety of common use cases,
including:

-   Financial analysis

-   Clickstream analysis

-   Healthcare record retention and processing

-   Social media data and sentiment analysis


### Financial analysis

In the financial industry, controlling risk is paramount, and the only
way to control risk is to understand it. Hadoop offers diverse options
for obtaining deep, data-driven insights and using them to quickly
evaluate potential risks, including the risk of fraud.

The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform offers single-tenant isolation
so that customers can address security needs for their financial data.

### Clickstream analysis

Keeping customers on a website requires understanding their motivations.
Using Hadoop, businesses can efficiently store and process enormous
volumes of clickstream data—information about how users view, scroll
over, and click through web pages. This can give them the opportunity to
analyze, visualize, and understand how their visitors are behaving on
their websites. Companies can also use clickstream data to instantly
respond to customer behavior, offering users special deals or
strategically re-targeting them. Forward-thinking retailers have made a
business practice out of this use case, and are more effectively
managing their ecommerce sites and online catalogs.

The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform simplifies the deployment and
maintenance of Hadoop, allowing marketers to speed up customer
intelligence initiatives without overburdening IT departments.
Traditionally, marketing organizations haven’t budgeted for
infrastructure or IT, so it is important to choose a platform that
restrains costs.

### Healthcare record retention and processing

Many healthcare organizations store large volumes of data for extended
periods of time, and they also need to meet stringent security standards
to protect patient privacy.

Hadoop is an inherently distributed system that can allow healthcare IT
teams to store data far more affordably than they could with relational
data-warehouse systems. And they will gain access to shared compute,
enabling them to run analytics and ad hoc queries on patient data. When
doctors are guided by data-driven insights and have instant access to
health records, they can make better-informed decisions faster.

With Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform, Rackspace and Hortonworks
experts facilitate the normally difficult process of deploying Hadoop.
Moreover, Rackspace offers a number of security solutions that
healthcare companies can choose from to help them meet their compliance
needs.

### Social media data and sentiment analysis

With Hadoop, businesses can quickly mine, archive, and analyze many
thousands of social media conversations for sentiment data—the ratio of
positive comments to negative comments—for example. Companies can assess
customers’ attitudes about their products, services, brand, and
competitors. They can then track those opinions over time.

From gathering data on social media platforms after a product launch to
tracking a decline in customer engagement on social media posts, Hadoop
enables businesses to leverage this kind of data in a number of ways to
make targeted, real-time decisions.

Businesses can Hadoop makes it possible to manage and exploit big data,
whether that means streaming social media feeds, or querying, refining,
and visualizing the information they contain. With Rackspace Managed Big
Data, you don’t need Hadoop experts, and social analytics projects like
these will become much more feasible for both IT and marketing. For
teams with limited Hadoop experience, Rackspace experts are always ready
to help users leverage Flume to stream Twitter feeds into HDFS, HCatalog
to build a relational view of the data, or Hive to query and refine it.


### Conclusion

For businesses seeking an easier way to start using and manage Hadoop,
the Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform is an ideal choice. Using the
popular Hortonworks Data Platform, it enables companies to reap the
benefits of big data without being hampered by deployment, optimization,
and maintenance challenges. Each environment is customized to fit
customers’ exact requirements, so they can take advantage of big data
insights while dedicating internal resources to initiatives that drive
the business forward.

Rackspace is constantly adding new and requested open-data platforms
like MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and MySQL that work alongside
