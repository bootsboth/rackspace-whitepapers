### TCO vs. Total Value

Traditionally, organizations focus on total cost of ownership (TCO) when
making IT decisions. How much it will cost and how much it will save.
The bottom line cost savings of deploying on the cloud is usually enough
to sell most businesses. And while discussing the less tangible *value*
of the cloud is more difficult, this is often where the most meaningful
impact is revealed.

TCO analysis typically consists of pure number crunching. The hardware
for a server upgrade has a fixed price, as does the software license.
It’s an important set of calculations in weighing options. For example,
in a [recent white paper exploring TCO
calculation](https://broadcast.rackspace.com/al/images/MV-Outsource-Infrastructure.pdf),
a benchmark company was able to save over $3 million in first-year
capital expenditure (CapEx) outlays alone.

But how do you put a price tag on time to market? Employee morale?
Freeing up time for experimentation and innovation? Or deepening your
current IT staff’s skills rather than hiring more personnel?

These benefits often trump the bare costs or savings involved with
embracing the cloud. The hidden value of cloud adoption attached to
these intangible benefits is largely dependent on your industry and
organizational structure.

Raw cost analysis is generally the first step in determining whether or
not a [managed cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/)- a
solution where the vendor actively manages, patches and troubleshoots
your cloud environment—is an effective way to solve the business problem
at hand. This paper is intended to provide guidance once the raw cost
analysis is complete. It can be used as a guide to discussing and
documenting the total value of ownership (TVO) that the managed cloud
can deliver.

We will discuss four areas and how they each demonstrate value for a
business:

-   Competitive Advantage
-   Time to Market
-   Adaptability
-   Employee Satisfaction

*“By 2015,* [*according to Gartner
research*](https://www.gartner.com/doc/2718918/cloud-computing-innovation-key-initiative#a1335578341)*,
50% of large global enterprises will rely on external cloud computing
services for at least one of their top 10 revenue-generating processes.”*

### Competitive Advantage

Often, businesses must choose between heavily financing one capability
to the detriment of another. Market conditions, compliance mandates or
IT budget limitations often set prioritization. However, organizations
can quickly fall behind, spending their time playing catch up instead of
innovating, without the tools to remain competitive. A managed cloud
approach enables the business to spend time on the type of strategic
work that moves the needle instead of just maintaining baseline
operations.

For example, online retailers can use performance data, load time
statistics and the impact of improved search rankings to justify
customer experience improvements on a [managed ecommerce
platform](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/). For each second
of website latency, online visitors experience a 7% reduction in
satisfaction, resulting in lower engagement and fewer conversions. So
any move to a robust, managed cloud platform holds the potential to
boost online satisfaction directly. Meanwhile, moving up in search
rankings translates directly to more qualified leads and sales activity.

### Time to Market

 Whether getting a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product to market on
time or deploying business critical applications like customer
relationship management (CRM) software or email, time to market is often
hampered by resource constraints that prevent completing a project on
budget and on schedule. David Wills, General Manager of Platform
Services at [Xero](http://stories.rackspace.com/customers/xero/),
slashed hosting costs by 40 percent using the managed cloud. But Wills
says the biggest benefit of the managed cloud is that Xero, “can spin up
environments within 15 minutes now whereas previously it used take us
over an hour.” [Wills
credits](http://stories.rackspace.com/customers/xero/) the ability to
deploy hardware faster with the managed cloud as a key factor in getting
Xero’s new features to market faster.

Clearly, managed cloud can save time—and cost—in procuring, testing and
deploying cloud infrastructure. Spend time identifying other
business-specific benefits you can gain by speeding up the time to
market that may be more difficult to quantify, such as:

-   How were sales disrupted by not getting the CRM deployed before the holiday
rush?
-   Are you missing opportunities because competitors have new functionality or
features (online customization, chat, enhanced mobile experience) that you
haven’t developed yet?
-   Can taking advantage of virtualization, automation and orchestration
services shorten lead times on new software releases?
-   What are the possible returns from automating processes like provisioning
and alert response using DevOps methods?

*To ready the Prepara website for a flood of traffic, Marc Ensign of
Sound-n-Vision relied on a managed cloud provider to handle scaling the
site for the rush. “Managed cloud was an extremely cost-effective
solution for us… Dedicated servers would have been 20 times the cost of
using the cloud. And we got an even better result than we would have on
dedicated because it was scalable. We could have added another 30
servers if we needed them,” [explains
Ensign](http://stories.rackspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CRP-Prepara-Case-Study-Final.pdf)*

### Adaptability

By encouraging experimentation, organizations gain the freedom to
investigate new directions with minimal risk. One of the biggest
impediments to innovation in many businesses is simply finding time for
IT to plan and pilot projects along with the hardware and software
resources to run it.

With demands on IT teams to do more with less, the value of chasing a
new initiative is usually trumped by the mandate to keep the lights on.
The increased flexibility of a managed cloud allows businesses to
quickly react to market shifts while preparing for the demands of the
future. It allows an organization to take a market-leader role instead
of playing catch up.

Let’s consider an accounting team that’s been clamoring for a more
tightly integrated billing and CRM system. For the level of complexity,
system coordination and security requirements that must be managed, the
integration requires something more customized and robust than a
SaaS-based approach allows. The business needs to build a complete
in-house solution.

If two system administrators weren’t tied up managing the bloated email
server, they could be meeting with the accounting and sales teams,
gathering requirements and investigating solutions. If the email servers
were managed externally—with strict security and service level
agreements (SLAs) in place—there would be more hardware and software
resources on-site to help the accounting team innovate.

Additionally, with a managed cloud approach, the IT team is able to
become more responsive and agile, reducing the chance of shadow IT and
reinforcing the team’s role as a partner to the business. According to a
recent study, combined increases in revenue and productivity due to
similar gains in agility are as high as
[$368,830](https://broadcast.rackspace.com/al/images/MV-Outsource-Infrastructure.pdf)
for a hypothetical financial services firm running approximately 40
servers over the course of a year.

*Creating the framework to achieve efficiency gains may require skills
that don’t currently exist in your organization or are hard to attain.
For Dario De Santis, Product and Engineering Manager with [noHold,
Inc.](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-provider-nohold-answers-the-call-with-rackspace-managed-cloud/),
an AI-based virtual assistant provider, the managed cloud provides
“experts available to us to help us understand our environment, which
empowers us to focus on our business and not on IT-related issues.” For
noHold, using managed cloud is a “deal-enabler and arms us with the
expertise to work with trusted global brands,” [says
DeSantis](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-provider-nohold-answers-the-call-with-rackspace-managed-cloud/)*

### Employee Satisfaction

When adopting the cloud, new competencies may need to be developed
within your organization or attained from outside experts. Your email
administrator may become a messaging architect, your web developer may
transform into a
[Magento](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/)
platform-certified technician. Embrace this change by offering employees
training to gain new skills. Recently developed expertise, higher
salaries and more job security, employees are less likely to leave.
Employees who are learning and growing in their roles are usually
happier over the long term.

Tedious chores like complex upgrades, migrations, patches and bug fixes
suck time and energy out of the IT team. Managed cloud lets these
professionals focus on higher-value projects that drive innovation.

Managed cloud providers have multiple teams of top quality, experienced
certified IT professionals across a range of disciplines like Red Hat,
Cisco, Microsoft, and so on. Tapping into the economy of expertise
available from a managed cloud provider means getting the expert you
need, when you need them, without adding headcount.

***Responding to Security Threats With Managed Cloud***

*When vulnerabilities were discovered in Bash (known as the Bash bug or
Shellshock), found in most versions of Unix, Linux and Mac OSX operating
systems, the security implications had IT teams scrambling to apply
patches and run security scans.*

*Managed cloud customers, on the other hand, were patched and secured
without the need for customers to drop what they were doing to react
accordingly.*

### Summary

Extending a team with the managed cloud allows a business to balance out
needs and add the capacity, functionality and expertise required to stay
viable in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Uncovering the total value of
ownership is just as important as calculating raw cost savings.

In addition to simple cost analysis, companies should focus on the value
gained from competitive advantage, time to market, adaptability and
employee satisfaction. This will give your stakeholders the most
complete picture of what to expect, allowing for better-informed
decisions.
