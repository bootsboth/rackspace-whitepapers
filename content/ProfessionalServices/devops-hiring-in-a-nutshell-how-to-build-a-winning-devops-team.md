### DevOps: A historical perspective

In many ways, software development has come full circle. During the
mainframe and client-server eras of IT—from the 1950s through the
1990s—programmers needed a working understanding of infrastructure. In
order to start coding, they likely needed to set up a server and
database first. But as the waterfall method of software development
became the norm, roles separated. Development and operations functions
became much more specialized. Programmers didn’t concern themselves with
infrastructure, and system administrators didn’t need to know
programming. When the code was finished, the developer tossed it over
the wall to the operations and QA teams for deployment. Feedback
trickled in slowly and was addressed in the next release, sometimes
months or years down the line.

In a world where software shipped on a CD once a year, the waterfall
method of development worked fine. The silos between development and
operations teams were perhaps never ideal, but they didn’t render the
process unworkable, either.

With the rise of the internet and cloud computing, some companies began
to recognize that new ways of working offered certain competitive
advantages.

In order to meet the demands of true web-scale computing, some
businesses began to adopt the Agile development methodology, shifting
the way they build and ship code. Rapid deployment and continuous
integration became the standard. It was no longer enough for businesses
to merely release a better product in order to stay competitive— they
also needed to build and ship it faster than everyone else.

To accomplish the goal of rapid, continuous deployment, some
organizations began to optimize their development methods. They tore
down the wall between development and operations. Rather than working in
silos, developers and operations teams collaborated and aligned their
efforts toward common business goals.

They discovered that infrastructure needed to be automated in order to
keep up. Under this faster method of development, code had to be pushed
from development to testing to staging and finally to the live
production environment as quickly as possible. When code breaks, it is
usually because one of these environments doesn’t look like the others.
It’s an easy fix when you only have 10 servers. But when you’re dealing
with multiple redundancies across global data centers—possibly thousands
of temporary instances—you need to manage your infrastructure en masse.
Many organizations found that configuration management tools like Chef
and Puppet provided the quickest and most effective way to configure
their environments identically.

The practice of incorporating these new cultural, organizational and
technological ways of working has come to be known as DevOps.

This new way of working requires a different kind of skill set.

### Understanding the DevOps skill set

There is a fierce debate within the DevOps community as to what the
ideal DevOps professional looks like.

Early on, Facebook<sup>&reg;</sup> famously championed the hiring of full-stack
programmers<sup>1</sup> - generalists with an understanding of both programming
and infrastructure. They pushed their developers to be aware of their
code’s production and architecture dependencies every step of the way,
and to solve infrastructure problems using code.

But there’s a contingent of DevOps practitioners who take issue with
this approach, arguing instead that there really is no such thing as a
full-stack programmer. Their concept of DevOps doesn’t necessarily mean
the complete absence of “Ops”—it just means that software engineers and
system administrators work more closely together, as specialists in
their practice areas rather than cross-team generalists.

Which side is employing the right approach to DevOps—the generalists or
the specialists? The answer is both. DevOps, in practice, means
different things to different organizations. And factors such as the
number of team members, company size and goals should influence the kind
of engineers businesses hire to fill these roles.

*To learn more about the different ways companies are putting DevOps
into practice, read our white paper, [The DevOps Mindset: Real-World
Insights From Tech
Leaders](http://www.rackspace.com/devops/the-devops-mindset).*

#### Early Stage Companies

While the cloud accelerated the adoption of DevOps practices across the
industry, the growth of DevOps was also spurred by the boom in startups.
There is a reason that companies like Facebook and Flickr were at the
forefront of the DevOps movement—they started small and grew rapidly. In
smaller startups with limited resources, developers are often forced to
wear multiple hats—from programming to running the company’s cloud
infrastructure.

For these types of companies, engineers who understand the entire stack
are essential. The size, speed and collaborative nature of the startup
model gives it a competitive advantage over larger organizations. It
breeds a culture where failing fast and deploying often is seen as a
virtue.

#### Mature Companies

As a company grows, however, roles inevitably shift. Facebook may have
been able to rely on everyone doing everything early on, but the
challenges and complexities of running a DevOps team at Facebook circa
2009 are very different from those faced by Facebook in 2014.

When a company begins to grow, it’s no longer feasible to expect
developers to do everything—getting products to market, responding to
customer needs and managing infrastructure at scale using code.
Technical roles at these larger organizations naturally become more
specialized, with programmers, dedicated QA specialists and even staff
focused exclusively on configuration management tools.

This means that DevOps at a mature company will look different than at a
startup, though the underlying principles are the same. “Specialized”
doesn’t mean going back to the waterfall method; the DevOps ethos is
still ingrained in every task.

Regardless of company size, it’s critical that everyone on the team
shares some understanding of how the entire system works, and that both
development and operations are clear on the business goals they are
driving toward. Once a business determines how they want to implement
DevOps, they need to begin the challenging process of finding the right
candidates.

### What to look for on a DevOps resume

First, these kinds of candidates may not actually be called “DevOps
engineers.” According to a Puppet Labs survey^2^, only 18 percent of IT
professionals say that there is someone in their organization that has
this title.

Some in the DevOps community are reporting a kind of backlash against
the term, which has become something of a buzzword in the industry.
[Adam Rabinovitch](http://www.adamrabinovitch.co.uk/), a London-based
recruiter who hires for DevOps teams, says that he doesn’t scan resumes
for the term “DevOps” anymore because it’s become ubiquitous. “I’d
rather look for someone with coding skills but who has a history of
utilizing the deployment tools that the business is using,” he says.
“I’d rather go back to your standard software engineer that’s been using
the right tools instead of looking for the word ‘DevOps.’”

If scanning for the word “DevOps” doesn’t work, how do you surface
qualified candidates from a pile of resumes? Here are a few key
considerations:

#### The Job Title

What’s in a name? It turns out not much. The types of professionals that
tend to thrive on a DevOps team may go by a number of different
titles—Systems Engineer, Network or System Administrator, Software
Engineer or Full-Stack Developer. More important than the job title,
however, is the professional experience that supports it.

#### The Non-traditional Career Path

Qualified DevOps engineers tend to be polymaths with non-traditional
career paths. Instead of rising from Developer to Sr. Developer, the
candidate may be a programmer who has taken a detour somewhere in their
career and become interested in infrastructure. Or it may be a System
Administrator who has a GitHub account packed with sideline code
projects.

And while professional experience counts for a lot, don’t discount
candidates who may wear one hat by day and another in their free time.
The most passionate candidates will often be the ones who have led
personal projects that illustrate a deep knowledge of both development
and infrastructure.

Think about IT skills as a spectrum, with traditional development on one
side and traditional operations roles on the other. The best DevOps
candidates fall somewhere near the middle. The precise combination of
coding and infrastructure skills you should seek will depend on the
specific role and functions for which you are hiring. But one thing is
certain—the ideal candidate will have some experience with both coding
and infrastructure.

#### The Experience With Infrastructure Automation Tools

On top of fluency in web languages such as Ruby, Python, PHP or Java,
the ideal DevOps engineer should have some experience using
infrastructure automation tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack or
Windows PowerShell DSC. These tools are at the heart of every successful
DevOps team, so experience using them to deploy code should elevate
candidates to the top of the resume pile.

But there’s a catch: This kind of expertise is scarce, and finding
experienced candidates presents a challenge for hiring managers.
According to [Prashanth
Chandrasekar](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/author/prashanthchandrasekar/),
General Manager of the [Rackspace^®^
DevOps](http://www.rackspace.com/devops) business segment, “Many of
these DevOps tools are relatively new and are evolving at a rapid pace
through the open source community. Every day new tools that perform very
specific functions (very efficiently) in the automation tool chain are
emerging. It’s very hard to find a fully skilled professional in the
market who has achieved a competent level of expertise on all these
rapidly evolving tools. Learning Chef is not an overnight task. You have
to invest a material amount of time to really use it effectively to
treat your infrastructure like code.”

There are myriad configuration management tools to choose from, and each
demands its own specific skill set. It’s important that the tools your
team implements and the people you’ve hired to automate your
infrastructure are aligned. “Chef, for example, was made with a
developer bias,” Chandrasekar says. “Whereas a tool like Ansible was
written for system administrators in a lot of ways.”

#### The Soft Skills: Hiring A Collaborative Communicator

Because DevOps is a cultural approach and not just a set of automation
tools, organizations should think about the interpersonal skills that
make DevOps practitioners successful. Cross-team communication and
collaboration strategies may be harder to screen for than technical
competencies, but they’re no less important.

Rabinovitch finds it useful to ask project-based questions, such as
“What was your greatest achievement on a recent project? What were your
goals? What did you achieve and what were the outcomes? What problems
did you face and how did you solve them in a way that met the team’s
goals?”

As a DevOps recruiter for Rackspace, Nate Frickel has found that the
soft skills are often as important as the hard technical qualifications.
“In the conversations I have with candidates, I’m listening for the
kinds of comments they are making about their current situation. Are
they the kind of person who is looking for a solution, or are they just
complaining about the other side?”

#### The Start-Up Mentality

Enterprises have historically worked in silos. As a result, they’ve
earned a reputation for moving slowly when it comes to innovation.
That’s one reason why DevOps teams tend to favor engineers with start-up
backgrounds.

“I spoke to one of my corporate clients,” Rabinovitch says. “They don’t
want someone who comes from a corporate background—not unless they want
to work with a start-up mentality.” Engineers with a history of success
on collaborative, fast- paced teams that continuously deploy code will
have the upper hand.

“The real ‘wow’ factor,” according to Chandrasekar, “is if they have
worked for a startup where they helped push code into production at a
rapid pace. If they were doing that as part of a small team, then we
know that they had a big impact.”

### Where are all the best candidates hiding?

<img src="{% asset_path ProfessionalServices/devops-hiring-in-a-nutshell-how-to-build-a-winning-devops-team/DevOpsHiring-2.png %}" width="555" height="224" />

With demand far outstripping the supply of qualified candidates, the
biggest challenge hiring managers and recruiters face is finding the
right person. While picking a great candidate from the resume pile
presents a challenge, often the best candidates are the ones that didn’t
submit an application. To locate these candidates, businesses need a
proactive hiring strategy.

LinkedIn<sup>&reg;</sup>, the world’s largest professional networking site, is
still a great source for finding would-be candidates, but it falls short in a
few respects.

While LinkedIn gives you a glimpse into a candidate’s work history, it
doesn’t showcase their actual work, or give you a picture of their
engagement with the growing DevOps community. In the last few years,
there have been a slew of articles highlighting another predicament:
engineers are being overwhelmed with messages from recruiters on
LinkedIn. It’s a good problem to have if you’re a developer, but if
you’re trying to build a DevOps team it can be frustrating.

As a result, recruiters are looking outside of traditional hiring
methods to source the best candidates. Here are some outside-the-box
places they are finding them:

**GITHUB – <https://github.com/>**

Companies are beginning to recognize that poring through GitHub
repositories is a great way to find developers who are demonstrating
their skills through open-source and private projects.

**STACK EXCHANGE / STACK OVERFLOW – <http://stackexchange.com/>**

Skilled developers can share their software expertise through Q&A and
discussions. It can be a good way to assess how engaged candidates are
with the larger community. Stack Exchange also has a job board, which
targets these kinds of candidates where they live.

**BLOGGERS**

The enthusiasm surrounding DevOps elevates it to more than just a
practice. To those involved, it’s a true movement. The best, most
experienced engineers are often those speaking the loudest. Blogging has
become a platform for skilled developers to demonstrate and share their
expertise.

**DEVOPS ZONE – <http://dzone.com/mz/devops/>**

DevOps Zone is kind of like Reddit for all-things DevOps—a forum where
anyone interested in DevOps can post articles and have discussions about
DevOps best practices. The developers participating in these discussions
and sharing their expertise will likely be among your most engaged and
qualified candidates.

**TWITTER<sup>&reg;</sup> – <http://www.twitter.com/>**

You can tell a lot about a candidate in 140 characters. Twitter’s search
tool makes it easy to find people who are driving the conversation
around DevOps. When reaching out to these candidates, remember that
Twitter is a platform that values genuine and personal engagement. A
cold-call message about a job opportunity may be perceived as spam
unless it’s preceded by some kind of authentic interaction.

**CONFERENCES – <http://devopsconferences.com/>**

Because DevOps is so new, there is high demand for experts to share best
practices with the greater community. Some of these conferences revolve
around specific tools like Chef, Puppet or Docker, while others, such as
Velocity and DevOpsDays, focus on DevOps in a broad and general way.

Any good hiring strategy should incorporate all of the above. It can be
time-consuming, but a multi-front approach will yield the best results.
In the words of Frank Odia, a Portland-based DevOps and Big Data
recruiter, “There is no hidden pool of talent. You have to try a lot of
different things. It takes a lot of networking and presenting your
company as a great place to work.”

### Building your team to scale

Assembling a winning team means thinking beyond the individual developer
and focusing on how your organization operates as a whole. Each area
below should be considered:

#### Developing Your Talent

Your greatest, untapped talent pool may be right where you’re standing.
Because DevOps skills are in such high demand, many organizations are
moving to infuse those skills into their current staff. Prashanth
Chandrasekar from Rackspace addressed this challenge by converting those
in traditional system administrator roles to DevOps engineers. “We are
going through the active process of training them,” he says, “because we
don’t feel there are enough of them out there. It gives people
aspirational learning opportunities and gives traditional sys admins
relevance in their careers.”

#### Retaining Your Talent

In its 2014 State of DevOps Report<sup>3</sup>, Puppet Labs confirmed that
organizational culture is key to retaining talent. A team’s culture and
whether it fosters an atmosphere conducive to learning are the two
primary determinants of job satisfaction among DevOps engineers—even
eclipsing salary by a significant margin. According to Frank Odia, in
order to interest qualified candidates, “companies are being much more
flexible. You take them where they are. They don’t have to be in an
office; they can work from a home office.”

By creating a great place to work, businesses can keep the talent they
have happy. Beyond the productivity gains that come along with job
satisfaction, this strategy will also act as a magnet for qualified
candidates in the market place.

#### Team Leadership

According to the Chicago Tribune,<sup>4</sup> “Getting along with your boss or
knowing your boss likes you can be more important than pay or benefits
when it comes to job satisfaction.” But the benefits of satisfied
workers go beyond employee retention. A bad leader can drag down a
high-performing team, while a great leader will inspire his or her staff
to take action, take risks and innovate.

The leader of a DevOps team needs to be able to facilitate and inspire
communication between teammates to make sure that there are blameless
postmortems, rather than an “us-versus-them” mentality.

In Chandrasekar’s case, the leader he chose for his DevOps team was
someone who came up through the ranks—someone with credibility among his
team, earned by developing products at Rackspace. He was the ideal
leader to instill a DevOps mindset in his team, because he embraced a
collaborative cultural approach in his own work. “If you’ve done it
before,” he says, “you have solved the same problems that the engineers
are facing.”

A leader who understands the technical problems and can help his team
overcome them in a collaborative fashion is a major asset to any DevOps
team.

#### Getting Outside Help

When companies try to implement DevOps, they quickly run into barriers.
Configuration management tools have steep learning curves, and necessary
organizational changes can be met with internal resistance. Because
DevOps is such a new practice, companies won’t find the slew of external
consultants that are common in other areas of IT.

But there are companies like Rackspace that have been deploying in a
DevOps fashion since before the term was coined. Whether companies are
looking for an outside expert to help ease their organizational
transition or someone to run their infrastructure (treating it as code),
these kinds of outside services can be useful extensions of their
internal development team.

#### Key takeaways

-   **DevOps is Rising:** The skills it takes to be a successful member of a
DevOps team are in short supply, but they are essential for teams that want to
continuously deploy and treat infrastructure as code.

-   **Type of Business Plays a Role:** If you’re an early-stage start up, you
will likely be looking for generalists who can wear multiple hats. If you work
at an enterprise, you may be looking for someone with more specialized experience.

-   **Experience with Automation Tools is a Plus:** By having experience in
infrastructure automation, candidates set themselves apart from other applicants.

-   **Value the Non-Traditional Career Path:** Developers who have moved into
infrastructure and system administrators with strong coding skills will be your
strongest candidates for these positions.

-   **Think Like a Start Up:** Even if you’re a Fortune 500 enterprise, you need
to be prepared to break down silos and move quickly to compete in a DevOps world.
The engineers you hire need to be prepared to work that way, too.

-   **Soft Skills Matter:** Great DevOps candidates need to be collaborative and
work in a blame-free manner.

-   **To Find The Right People, Look Everywhere:** Just searching on LinkedIn
may not be enough. Look for talent on GitHub, Stack Exchange, Twitter and at
conferences as well. Remember that the bloggers and community thought leaders
will often be your most passionate and skilled candidates.

-   **Scaling Your Team:** Think about where you want your team to go long-term
and build a strategy to hire and develop the skills you need to get there.
