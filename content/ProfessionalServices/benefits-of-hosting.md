What if your IT team could focus their expertise on building your
business instead of maintaining your servers? What if you had a backup
team of experts focused strictly on hosting, available to you 24-7-365,
freeing you to pursue your mission critical projects instead of
upgrading hardware, dealing with downtime or figuring out how to handle
a sudden increase in traffic to your website?

Working with a hosting provider can make these scenarios possible. The
right partner can relieve you and your IT team from the time-consuming
chores and challenges of web hosting. Every hour of every day, a hosting
provider’s focus is solely on hosting, so yours doesn’t have to be.

Hosting offers many benefits to companies of all sizes, from one-person
shops to global conglomerates. It’s a cost-effective solution for those
with mission-critical websites and applications that need 100% network
uptime, support responsiveness, technical expertise and a secure,
high-end infrastructure. Here are some considerations as you explore how
outsourcing your hosting can benefit your company.

### Cost Efficiency

Hosting boosts the efficiency of your budget by removing the need for
big capital outlays on hardware and data centers, as well as the payroll
required for regular maintenance and upgrades. It’s a matter of
converting capital expenditures into operating expenditures: the money
you now put into purchasing, maintaining and upgrading hardware and
software could instead be allocated to new strategic projects for your
IT department. In a hosted environment, you pay as you grow instead of
over-purchasing capacity upfront. This saves you dollars in server
hardware, software, upgrades and man-hours needed to run it all.

### Growth

When your company grows, your infrastructure must also grow. Since
hosting providers have extensive hardware and software resources, they
can help you scale smoothly and easily. A good hosting provider is
always ready for your growth, whether it’s steady, incremental expansion
or a rapid deployment of a hosting environment. The elastic nature of
cloud computing also helps ensure seamless growth.

As the world’s leader in hosting, Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> works to handle
your company’s growth needs today and in the future. With customers, offices
and data centers across the globe, we see the big picture, understanding
and creating solutions that will address your global IT needs today and
years from now.

### The Latest Technology, Automatically

Since hosting providers focus on their specific area of expertise, they
can stay on top of the latest advances in their industry. This lets you
take advantage of the latest technologies without the expense of adding
equipment or staff. You benefit from the latest in hardware and software
technology, managed by experienced engineers. At Rackspace, we work
closely with the world’s leading commercial and open source developers
to ensure that we’re on the cutting edge of emerging technology for all
our hosted apps.

In addition, hosting providers continually download and install software
upgrades and security patches, so your system is always up-to-date. A
hosting provider can also help achieve the compliance and regulatory
requirements you need for your industry.

### What Can You Expect from Your Hosting Provider?

Expertise and experience. Everything hosting providers do revolves
around IT hosting. Their systems and processes are built exclusively for
delivering IT hosting. At Rackspace, our team includes hundreds of
Certified Network Technicians, all trained to the highest industry
standards, and our support staff is highly trained for supporting
complex hosting environments.

#### Support

Entrusting your hosting duties to another entity is a big step. We aim
to make the transition as easy as possible with superior service
throughout the process. Rackspace believes that being a great hosting
provider requires more than just the best technologies, but the best of
support and service. To ensure a high level of comfort, Rackspace has
created a process called ***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***. This means
there’s a dedicated Rackspace Support Team that’s specifically built around
you and your needs. It’s the Team’s responsibility to know and understand
your configuration, your goals and you.

All of this translates into no more call centers; no more dealing with a
different person every time you need something; no more getting shuffled
from one random expert to another. Any time of the day or night, you
will get a live person on the phone—a capable, knowledgeable, creative,
resourceful individual committed to helping you.

#### Security

Hosting companies integrate extensive security measures to protect your
data from threats both physical and online. At Rackspace, we partner
with leaders in the security industry to give you the strongest level of
protection available. Rackspace Hosting Security is a powerful, fully
integrated portfolio of services, managed devices and best practices,
all designed to ensure the highest levels of security for customer data.

#### Customization

Every business has a unique need and budget. A hosting provider can help
you develop the highly-customized hosting environment specifically for
your company’s needs. Rackspace delivers a portfolio of solutions like
Managed Hosting, Cloud Hosting and Email Hosting, each with a diverse
mix of products. Because needs change – sometimes rapidly – our model is
built to adjust to customer needs quickly and efficiently.

### How to Get Started with Hosting

Check out your options. Here are a few questions to ask a potential
hosting provider.

-   Is the company financially sound and profitable?
-   Do they deliver, not just guarantee, the uptime you need?
-   How much are they investing in new products and services?
-   How meaningful and clear are their guarantees to your business?
-   What experts will they make available to you?
-   Do they offer a range of hosting services to meet all your needs?
-   Do they provide unlimited support 24-7-365 or fee-based support?
-   Do they support the compliance standards that are critical to you?
-   Are they growing and upgrading their infrastructure?

### Test the Waters

If you’re thinking about giving managed hosting a try, consider testing
the waters by outsourcing smaller, low-end workloads. Start by
offloading the components that have a low criticality. As you gain
confidence in your hosting provider, gradually transfer more
responsibility to them.

### Move Upstream

With a trusted hosting partner, you’re positioned for a long-term shift
in the role of IT in your company. Your team can fully integrate into
other groups in your company, focusing time and resources on the
strategy pieces that require your expertise. Your team will be free to
use their IT expertise to move forward instead of constantly being
sidetracked by server issues and maintenance.
