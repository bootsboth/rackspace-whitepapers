### The new world of DevOps

DevOps isn't just another IT buzzword. DevOps is here to stay. According
to our 2014 DevOps Adoption report (conducted by Vanson Bourne, a
technology research firm, and commissioned by Rackspace), the vast
majority of surveyed businesses have either already implemented DevOps
practices (51 percent of respondents) or were planning to implement them
(35 percent of respondents).

At Rackspace, we help many different companies succeed in their DevOps
journey. In this paper, we review what DevOps is and how it challenges
prevailing IT processes, organizational structures and cultural
expectations. Then we dive deeper into the primary aspects of DevOps and
how to get them right.

#### What does DevOps really mean?

DevOps is an emerging trend that continues to evolve, so definitions
vary. But here's what it means to us at Rackspace:

DevOps is a combination of culture, processes, and technologies that
empower software development and IT operations teams to work closely
together to enable the fastest time-to-market and maximum business
agility.

If you're a developer, that might sound like business jargon. But most
practitioners and analysts agree with us on a few key points. In short,
DevOps is about:

1.  Breaking down silos, especially between developers and ops engineers
2.  Automating infrastructure wherever it makes sense
3.  Shipping high-quality code fast through processes like continuous
integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), usually facilitated by the cloud

#### Why should I care about DevOps?

Our DevOps Adoption report reveals that most surveyed businesses using
DevOps are already realizing a wide range of real, measurable benefits
as a direct result of implementing DevOps practices.

Technical benefits include faster delivery of new features (for 57
percent of respondents), more stable operating environments (46 percent)
and reduced application downtime (44 percent). In turn, these have led
directly to successful business outcomes such as improved customer
satisfaction (for 52 percent of respondents) and reduced IT
infrastructure spend (49 percent).

### The old IT - Siloed and slow

To successfully implement DevOps practices and technologies, you first
need to understand how the DevOps trend currently challenges the way
most IT departments have functioned for many decades.

Despite the large percentage of surveyed organizations that have already
begun or are planning to start their DevOps journey, the IT function in
most enterprises looks like this:

+-----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
|  DEVELOPMENT (Dev)                            |  QUALITY TESTING                           |  OPERATIONS (Ops)                             |
+===============================================+============================================+===============================================+
|  **Silo 1:** Develop                          | **Silo 2:** Test                           | **Silo 3:** Deploy                            |
+-----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
|  **Who:** Developers                          | **Who:** Testers /QA Analysts              | **Who:** Sys admins, DBAs and network admins  |
+-----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
|  **What:** Writing code for new applications, | **What:** Making sure applications are fit | **What:** Provisioning and managing servers   |
| customizations to licensed applications       | for purpose before being released to       | to run applications, monitoring performance,  |
| or new versions of existing applications      | production, and reporting bugs back        | fixing problems and system bottlenecks        |
|                                               | to developers for fixing                   |                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

This means four things for the application development and deployment
process:

-   **It's siloed** - The functions often don't sit in the same building.
Sometimes they're even in different time zones, and day-to-day collaboration is
minimal.

-   **It's linear -** One job starts when another finishes. QA starts when the
dev team hands over a release for testing. Operations start when a completed app
is released for production.

-   **It's manual** - Lots of human effort is required at every stage, from
writing and testing the code to installing and provisioning servers.

-   **It's slow** - It can take months to get a new application or new
functionality in front of users. Inflexible deployment cycles and sluggish
time-to-market make it hard to create a competitive advantage.

The prevalence of the cloud has transformed this traditional approach to
developing, testing, and deploying software.

### The new DevOps plus cloud

To take advantage of the cloud's improved speed and flexibility,
development and operations teams need to work together more closely and
productively. That's where DevOps comes in. But change is always hard.
Building a DevOps culture means using the following principles, referred
to collectively as CAMS:

-   **Collaborate -** Create an environment where dev and ops teams can work
towards common business objectives that are set at the top levels of the business.
This can involve everything from physically moving teams to be near each other
to finding good collaboration tools, agreeing on a common language and even
organizing social events.

-   **Automate -** Remove any manual processes that can slow down the continuous
delivery model.

-   **Measure -** Identify metrics and continuously measure success (and failure)
to learn what works and what to avoid.

-   **Share -** Feed results back to everyone who can use them productively.


When we work with our enterprise customers to help them improve DevOps
processes, we apply the CAMS principles to four areas of their business:

1.  People
2.  Applications
3.  Services
4.  Technology


The information in this article addresses each of these areas and
provide tips for creating a DevOps culture in your organization.

### Creating a DevOps culture

For organizations that run the siloed model, moving to DevOps requires a
radical change in thinking, culture, and approach. Although dev and ops
engineers are probably already breaking down walls and collaborating
informally, for DevOps to become part of organizational culture, the
change needs to be driven from the top.

#### What do we mean by *the top*?

Usually *the top* the person who has ultimate accountability for both
software development and IT operations. That role might be different in
different organizations: It could be the CIO, the CTO, or the COO. In
technology-driven businesses, like ecommerce companies it could even be
the CEO.

#### Enable DevOps

To enable DevOps, it is critical that key stakeholders:

-   Understand that a DevOps approach can transform agility and competitiveness
-   Convince non-IT senior management of the need for DevOps
-   Know what has to be done to make the change happen
-   Implement and lead a plan for transition (or identify someone to do it)
-   Motivate everyone to get on board with the plan
-   Measure and report on the success of the DevOps transition on an ongoing
basis

### Building aplications for the cloud

To reap the full benefit of the cloud, applications need to be
architected from the ground up of the cloud environment. Although some
legacy applications can be ported to the cloud, cloud-native
applications can best exploit the cloud's speed and agility. In a DevOps
environment, that means ensuring dev and ops teams can work together to
accomplish the following tasks:

#### Build for scale

Ensure that everyone has a good understanding of the underlying cloud
platform, so devs can build apps and components that are capable of
scaling instantly and effortlessly.

#### Build for fail

One of the fundamental aspects of the cloud is that it's built on
hundreds or thousands of low-cost commodity servers, so it's not
uncommon for an individual node to fail. The key is to architect cloud
applications to glide effortlessly over localized failure without the
user noticing anything.

#### Automate everything

The more the development and deployment process can be automated, the
faster and smoother it will be. DevOps teams should try to automate as
much as possible, so that traditional bottlenecks (like the days it used
to take to provision a new server) disappear.

#### Reduce costs

When dev and ops teams work together more efficiently and automate
time-consuming processes, a natural outcome is lower transactional
costs. Additionally, after scale is achieved, costs remain the same,
while users increase dramatically.

### Agility - Componentize everything

When you're working in the cloud and something goes wrong, you need to
be able to fix it as quickly and as easily as possible. The key is to
approach everything in a modular fashion, so you need to fix or replace
only the faulty component rather than the whole system. This enables you
to keep moving at cloud speed, which means improving time-to-market,
without obstacles dragging down the rate of innovation. We call this
principle **componentize everything**, and it applies at all levels of
the cloud. Some examples include:

-   **Application development -** Build and release applications in small,
discrete chunks for rapid iteration, testing, and deployment. If one part of an
app fails, you need to rewrite only that part. CI and CD allow teams to quickly
verify builds, identify bugs, and deploy production-ready software.

-   **Cloud infrastructure -** Build clouds from many, low-cost hardware
components. If one fails, then the system works around it and the faulty node
can be replaced.

-   **Cloud services -** From infrastructure providers to cloud tool vendors,
ensure that you can easily swap vendor services in and out, so you aren't held
back by contracts that no longer meet your needs.

### Using the right tools for the job

As mentioned previously, automating time-consuming software deployment
and infrastructure management tasks is an important step toward
achieving DevOps goals like improved time-to-market. You need to choose
the right tools and gain access to the skills that you need to maintain
and use them effectively.

#### Which tools to use

The tools that you use depend on your stack, your current in-house
skills, and your team's preferences. For example, one of the most
important choices you make might be whether to use Chef or Windows
PowerShell DSC for configuration management. If you're running a Windows
stack and using .NET, Windows DSC might be a better fit. If you're
running a Linux stack, you may want to use Chef. The tool that you
choose depends on your particular situation.

To get these critical technology decisions right from the beginning,
it's important to rely on engineers experienced with DevOps processes
and infrastructure automation. Most businesses choose a combination of
the following three options:

-   Allocate current dev and ops resources to learn these tools.
-   Hire new talent (ideally with real-world experience).
-   Leverage a managed services provider with deep DevOps experience.


Every organization is different, and choosing the right tools depends on
a wide range of factors. But to get you started, here is a basic
introduction to some of the DevOps tools we use to help our customers.

### Boost capacity and expertise with Managed Services

Here's another key question when you're planning your DevOps initiative:
To what extent will your business leverage managed DevOps service
providers to bolster your operations team and deliver guidance around
new processes, tools, and culture challenges?

According to the Rackspace-commissioned DevOps Adoption report, a
significant majority of surveyed organizations currently using DevOps
practices (70 percent) choose to work with managed DevOps service
providers like Rackspace. Why do so many turn to external expertise?

It's more economical. Improved cost efficiency was the most commonly
cited reason for using managed DevOps services (59 percent of
respondents). By leveraging a trusted service provider, businesses gain
access to expert DevOps engineers and developers as a support function
to their team without the expense of hiring, training, developing, and
retaining highly sought-after talent.

It frees devs to write code. Half of businesses relying on managed
DevOps services (50 percent of respondents) say that relying on an
external partner “allows them to focus on innovation.” A managed hosting
provider like Rackspace can handle the management of customers' DevOps
tools like PowerShell DSC, as well as their infrastructure (maintenance,
patching, monitoring, and so on).

Although it's still important for developers in a DevOps organization to
communicate closely with their provider and think carefully about how
their code will be deployed, these managed services address one of the
most common criticisms of DevOps, it can distract developers from doing
what they do best &151; writing high-quality code.

### Quick quiz

The following questions can help you assess how ready your organization
is for DevOps:

-   Where in the hierarchy does accountability for dev and ops meet?
-   Are there release-frequency-based goals and objectives in performance criteria?
-   How frequently are you able to release code to production?
-   How often do dev and ops teams speak?
-   Are customers starting to demand faster and better service from you?

    DevOps](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/businesses-are-finding-real-value-cost-savings-with-devops/)


### Realizing the promise of DevOps

The cloud is all about being able to move (and learn, adapt and evolve)
faster than your competitors. DevOps isn't a prerequisite for taking
advantage of cloud. You can still gain immense cost, efficiency, and
agility benefits from the cloud without reorganizing for DevOps.

But when you create a culture in which every layer of your organization,
from people to technology infrastructure can work at cloud speed, with
no barriers, miscommunication or bottlenecks, nothing can slow you down.
