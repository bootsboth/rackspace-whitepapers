**Customer’s Business:** Enterprise
mobility gateway helping healthcare and other Fortune 500s bring apps to
market and solve compliance challenges.

**Challenges:** Deliver reliable and scalable platform with encrypted
data storage. Handle unpredictable, spiky traffic from myriad devices
running on variant bandwidth.

**Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Solution:**
[Dedicated](http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers)
and [Cloud Servers with Managed Service
Level](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud),
[RackConnect<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect),
[ObjectRocket](http://objectrocket.com/).

**Business Outcome:** Reduced operating cost, higher confidence in
security of sensitive data.

### Rackspace relationship lowers cost and improves security.

Whenever a major industry such as healthcare is overhauled, even the
savviest players need to know quickly how to navigate change.

Headquartered in Philadelphia, enterprise mobility specialist CloudMine
is helping healthcare and pharmaceuticals customers improve efficiency
and data security in a rapidly evolving marketplace of mobile devices
and apps.

“Our software sits between the large set of corporate data systems that
exist today, such as Oracle, Peoplesoft, and well-known electronic
medical record (EMR) systems, and bridges that data securely to mobile
and connected devices attached to the public Internet,” said Marc Weil,
CloudMine CTO.

CloudMine customers and prospects need to be able to use mobile apps and
connected devices to stay competitive, while also addressing the data
storage and usage requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act’s (HIPAA) Privacy and Security rules.

“Companies are investing in mobility, such as the production of iPad
applications for improving doctor-patient communication,” said Weil.
“With Rackspace, we have an HIPAA-compliant solution that ensures our
customers’ ability to build these applications securely while still
taking advantage of the parts of CloudMine that increase speed-to-market
and reduce TCO for these apps.”

CloudMine’s customers are investing in many new state-of-the-art
technologies in their industries. Pharmaceutical companies are building
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled medical devices such as personal
glucose sensors, heart rate monitors, and medicine injectors that use
CloudMine to store all the patient-specific data that each device
collects. Analytics and data processing solutions can later use this
data to gain insight into improving medication compliance and product
usability.

“We built our platform as the foundation for this,” said Weil. “The
challenge is getting data into and out of a large variety of devices
running on many different cellular networks in a secure manner, all
while keeping the product easy to use for the developer.”

### The Cloudmine Solution, Powered By Rackspace

CloudMine was more than up for the challenge, but to really nail it they
also recognized they would need to work with a provider like Rackspace
that could design and deliver a reliable and secure [hybrid
solution](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid) to store sensitive data
and scale to handle traffic.

Rackspace allows CloudMine to focus on what it does best without having
to worry about infrastructure. “Every business needs a support
structure,” Weil said. “No matter what you’re building, you’re always
relying on a partner or a vendor to supply the underpinnings. It’s
really nice to know that Rackspace is just a phone call away.”

CloudMine can concentrate properly on data in and out of the MongoDB
opensource database while Rackspace expertly handles administration,
replication, backups, encryption and more.

“Rackspace has allowed us to do is to augment our internal Ops team with
the ObjectRocket team within Rackspace,” said Weil. “This allows our
engineers to focus on higher value tasks.”

And of course, there’s the legendary [Rackspace ***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/about/). Added Weil: “Rackspace is
willing to roll up its sleeves and work with us to design a tailored,
optimal architecture for our solution. Our contacts do a fantastic job
of walking us through our solution – even helping us implement and test
it before putting it in production. It’s like having our own [DevOps
engineering team](http://www.rackspace.com/devops) outside of
CloudMine.”

### A Secure Future

Everyone from engineers and architects to federal regulators is trying
to figure out what defines a secure cloud environment. With HIPAA
compliance, security becomes an essential of CloudMine’s business. The
extensive [cloud security expertise of
Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/security/solutions/) staff helps
CloudMine meet its various customers’ security audit processes.

Now CloudMine is able to provide its customers with all the security
information and audits that Rackspace has undergone for their
datacenters as a show of proof that the company is storing its data in a
secure location, in a manner customers are familiar with.

“We have part of our platform deployed on dedicated, bare metal boxes
with no virtualization layer running in a datacenter that we know
everything about,” said Weil. “And we have some of our technology
running in a secure cloud environment as well, integrated with our bare
metal using RackConnect<sup>&reg;</sup>.”

As CloudMine looks to what’s next, the company feels good about
Rackspace as a partner as it develops more and varied mobile offerings.
“Right now, we’re speaking with Rackspace about additional managed
CloudMine deployments,” Weil said. “Rackspace has really shown a true
investment and value in us, not only as a customer, but also as a
partner. And that’s something that we really appreciate.”
