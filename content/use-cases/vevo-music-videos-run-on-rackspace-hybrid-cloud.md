**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:** Websites, Rich Media

**CHALLENGES:** Storage and Transfer of large media files

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [RackConnect<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/)
used for management of large media files in a dedicated environment
including custom servers and managed storage, in combination with
[scalable compute in the
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/)
for CPU-intensive data transcoding and manipulation

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Compute scalability and cost efficiency, allowing
for in-house mass batch transcodes.

**Web-based music video and entertainment service spins up 900 servers for
massive transcoding project.**

### Company overview

Every day, millions of consumers look to the Internet as their go-to
source for music—whether downloading tunes to a mobile device or
streaming music videos from a website.

Created in 2009 to address the emerging trend of online music videos,
VEVO’s successful business model relies on [Rackspace^®^ Hybrid
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/), maximizing scalability
and performance by aligning workloads with best-fit computing
resources.

Today, VEVO gets nearly 52 million visitors in the U.S. per month, and
serves up four billion streams worldwide. None of that would be possible
without a solid IT infrastructure behind the scenes, which is why VEVO
has relied on Rackspace for its infrastructure needs.

### Outsourcing for performance

VEVO’s applications require complex hardware capable of supporting
processing-intensive operations like ingesting video content from music
companies and publishing it to VEVO syndication partners. They must also
support the delivery of very high-quality video, which depends upon
scalable, high-performance storage from NetApp.

“Many of our HD videos range from 2-4GB each,” notes Ivan Yang, director
of systems engineering at VEVO.

The company therefore decided early on that it wanted to outsource its
server management to a third party. Ultimately, they chose to build in
Rackspace Hybrid Cloud because it allowed them to leverage both cloud
and dedicated resources and connect them with
[RackConnect<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/dedicated_cloud/rackconnect/).
The [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)
backing all Rackspace products was also a draw.

### Hybrid model allows for scaling in the cloud

VEVO is using [Rackspace Cloud
Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/) to support
processing-intensive and load sensitive operations like scaling and
operating the VEVO data layer. In order to connect these cloud servers
to their other dedicated hosted servers and storage, VEVO uses
RackConnect. RackConnect grants VEVO the agility to add database read
replicas without the hassle and financial burden of purchasing physical
hardware to produce on such a large scale.

With VEVO’s expanding growth, they were able to scale out the backend
data and caching layer to accommodate extra traffic. “We were able to
add additional SQL Servers to power our backend with low latency read
replicas. Improving performance at the caching layer was also achieved
by easily adding more memcached nodes in Rackspace Cloud,” says Yang.

RackConnect gives VEVO the freedom to choose which platform works best
for their needs and leverage the technology in a way that suits their
business systems. Through an automated process built by VEVO on
dedicated gear at Rackspace, record labels can push content during busy
times like album releases. Music videos, housed on dedicated NetApp
storage, can be quickly transferred across F5 load balancers to Cloud
Servers spun up to handle transcoding for various mobile or computing
platforms. F5 load balancers also handle all incoming traffic requests
and direct clients to pools of servers containing content tailored to
the client’s source IP address and country code. This enables VEVO to
optimize their user experience and highlights one of the advantages of
combining cloud resources with traditional enterprise grade hardware.

Even with the use of a
[CDN](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/technology/?page=cdn) for
video content delivery, VEVO produces tens of terabytes of web traffic
per month. High-performance dedicated hardware is well suited for this
steady-state traffic, while Rackspace Cloud Servers provide a better
answer for temporary spikes in demand. This is what makes the [hybrid
computing model](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/)work; without
both cloud and dedicated resources, the solution would not have been as
flexible or cost effective. VEVO can quickly add the right amount of
computing power when needed, ensuring that the premium music video
content that consumers demand is processed and delivered as efficiently
as possible.

### Backed by Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>

VEVO started with a small number of servers, which it used for its
development, test and QA servers. Thanks to [***Rackspace Fanatical
Support***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/), the rollover
to its full server footprint was seamless when it was ready to move into
production.

VEVO hit the scene with a brand new business model that made it
difficult to predict the amount of traffic the launch would create. It
was a big moment in the music industry, with launch parties featuring
A-list celebrities and heavy media attention. “We flipped the switch,
and went almost immediately from having zero traffic to millions of
hits,” says Yang.

Rackspace played a key role in helping manage the launch, and continues
to scale as VEVO’s need for raw computing power increases. “We had
people from Rackspace here onsite to help us monitor the traffic and
make tweaks in real time to enhance the site’s performance,” Yang notes.
The team started with 10 servers, then stood up another 20 over the next
48 hours. “It reflects the Rackspace Fanatical Support motto. It was a
very intense period, and Rackspace was right there in the room,
brainstorming with us.”

VEVO’s unique usage of a wide array of Rackspace Hybrid Cloud
products — from managed hosting, to custom equipment collocation, to Cloud
Servers — allows millions of users access to their favorite artists and
continues to revitalize the music video industry.
