**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:** Design and develop embedded software products

**CHALLENGES:** Determining the best way to handle email management for
a new business venture

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Exchange
Hybrid](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hybrid/) to
combine [Rackspace
Email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/)and
[Microsoft
Exchange](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/)
mailboxes on the same domain

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Business email hosting with the same features and
support of internally managed email

### Solving the Email Management Dilemma

After a management buyout, IntervalZero, maker of embedded software
products in Massachusetts, found themselves evaluating whether their
email would be best served by an on-premise solution with third-party
maintenance or a completely off-premises hosting solution. According to
Daron Underwood, Vice President of Engineering, “as important as email
is, not having adequate resources to support it was not an option.”

After carefully balancing the initial and ongoing costs of on-premises
email, Daron decided that outsourcing would provide the dedicated
attention and expertise that modern email demands. According to Daron,
“Trying to focus time and energy into IT would take us away from our
core values.”

### IntervalZero Chooses Rackspace for Flexibility and Support

While looking at Rackspace for other IT Hosting needs, he discovered our
Cloud Office services. “I had shopped around for other options but
hadn’t seen any other solution that compared to the Rackspace offering,”
says Daron. IntervalZero uses Rackspace for all of their mailboxes,
taking advantage of the flexibility of the Exchange Hybrid option.

With the hybrid, IntervalZero maintains Rackspace Email and Microsoft
Exchange mailboxes in the same domain, under the same account, even
managed through the same Control Panel. Instead of being forced into
paying for features some users don’t need in order to allow other users
the features they do need, he provisions Rackspace Email or Exchange
mailboxes based on specific user needs and saves $8 per mailbox, per
month. “Affordable price was a factor but the uptime guarantee really
tipped the scales to Rackspace,” says Daron.

During the sales and transition process, “By phone or email, every
question I asked was answered immediately. What the rep couldn’t answer,
they found the answers and followed up quickly.” The Transition Team was
“very helpful” during the setup process. And, when Daron had questions
about setting up remote access, our support team sprung into action with
the answers he needed.

### Corporate-Level Support with Rackspace

In finding the best email hosting provider for his new business venture,
Daron gained guaranteed uptime, security, support for mobile phones, and
premium spam and virus protection. IntervalZero can keep a laser sharp
focus on their business goals while enjoying the type of expert,
accessible support they were accustomed to from corporate-level IT
resources.

Daron has already benefited from the constant improvements to [Control
Panel](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/control_panel/) functionality. “I
really enjoy the constant upgrades, including the one to upload new
users from a spreadsheet,” says Daron. He was able to use that feature
as soon as we released it to quickly create new mailboxes.

Even though Daron is significantly tech savvy in his own right, he
admits, “It’s nice to know you guys are there when I need help.” Since
the switch, Daron says he’s extremely satisfied with his service and
experience with Rackspace.
