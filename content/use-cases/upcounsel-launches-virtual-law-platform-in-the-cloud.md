**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** UpCounsel is a marketplace for legal services where
businesses can access a high-quality legal workforce on demand.

**CHALLENGES:** UpCounsel is an upstart business with demanding software
development requirements and a strong need for a stable and scalable
platform. The capital required to build and administer a data center is
prohibitive in the early stages of a startup.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Cloud
Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/) with [Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>
SQL Server](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/web-hosting/mysql/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** The scalability and flexibility of the Rackspace
cloud allows UpCounsel to maintain a lean IT strategy as it grows. Using
the Windows Server OS and Microsoft SQL Server Database Software,
UpCounsel needs a hosting partner who understands the .NET developer.

**Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Cloud Servers<sup>&trade;</sup> scale with startup
UpCounsel’s rapid growth.**

### Company overview

Securing legal services as a business is often a frustrating, expensive
process. Based in San Francisco and launched in 2012, startup [UpCounsel
is a marketplace for legal services](https://www.upcounsel.com/) where
businesses can access a high-quality legal workforce on demand.

UpCounsel’s platform provides a variety of tools, but its primary goal
is to help businesses find, hire and pay attorneys and to make
client-lawyer relationships easier. UpCounsel also serves attorneys,
handling billing and administration and making it easy for them to
access and serve clients remotely and collaborate with other attorneys.

As a growing startup disrupting its industry, UpCounsel needed a hosting
provider that could provide flexibility and scalability while supporting
Microsoft environments and .NET. Mason Blake, CTO and Co-founder of
UpCounsel, says, “Our vision to disrupt the legal industry requires us
to think big, and in order to do that we need a partner like Rackspace
providing the cloud technology we need to help us get there.”

### Cloud-enable disruption

UpCounsel’s business model disrupts the legal vertical in an
unprecedented way. Matt Faustman, CEO and Co-founder of UpCounsel, says,
“The legal industry is becoming far more fragmented, which makes it even
harder to find a great, high-quality attorney. We thought to ourselves,
‘Why can’t we coordinate a massive group of talent, the same way that a
law firm does, but at a fraction of the cost?’

“Before starting UpCounsel,” Faustman continues, “I was an attorney
working with startups, and my co-founder had been the lead developer at
numerous startups. We both saw that it was very difficult for small and
midsize businesses to access cost-effective legal services. We realized
that this was an area that really had a lot of disruption
possibilities.”

Hosting on-premise would have been prohibitively expensive for
UpCounsel. Rackspace cloud gave them a scalable environment with minimal
upfront capital expenditure, allowing them to focus on disrupting the
legal field rather than getting bogged down in infrastructural concerns.

### Scalability and flexibility

UpCounsel required a cloud hosting provider that could successfully
scale with them. Having worked with Rackspace in the past, Blake knew
the company as a trusted cloud provider.

“Hosting services are incredibly important, and we chose Rackspace from
the beginning,” explains Blake. “It’s a critical component to any online
business, especially when you talk about dealing with businesses and
legal services, and a place where money is transacted. We need to make
sure that our site is available 24/7. I knew when we started building
out the infrastructure and the backend that I was going to go with
Rackspace. There was no doubt in my mind. I have never had an issue with
Rackspace in the nearly ten years that I’ve worked with them.”

Rackspace cloud gave UpCounsel the flexibility they needed to build a
scalable, transactional website infrastructure. “Rackspace cloud
provides an incredible amount of flexibility for us. With the open API,
spinning up servers at the click of a button, cloud storage, load
balancing and provisioning up and down, it’s about as simple as it can
get,” says Blake. “Allowing us to grow to scale in an automated fashion
is critical for us. We wanted to make sure that our growth was not
inhibited by the infrastructure of the platform.”

### Running UpCounsel on Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>

The ability to build on a Windows environment was a major factor in
Blake’s decision to go with Rackspace. When you run Windows Server on
the Rackspace cloud, your applications run just like they do in a
dedicated environment. You can migrate your complex configurations or
choose from one of the Rackspace standard Windows environments, and
deploy servers within minutes, as needed.

Rackspace also offered the deep understanding of .NET that Blake sought.
“I have been working with .NET since it was in beta” says Blake. “My
greatest strengths lie in building and scaling applications on the .NET
platform. Windows is a critical component as well, and being able to
have Windows options available on our host was required.”

UpCounsel’s use of Microsoft’s operating system, implementing the latest
Windows Server and SQL Server Database Software at Rackspace is a prime
example of how this group of companies focuses on the evolving needs of
the growing developer base. “I feel as though Rackspace is an important
part of UpCounsel’s growth,” says Blake. “We are growing incredibly
fast, and it’s not going to slow down. Rackspace allows us to not worry
about the infrastructure and not worry about how we are going to scale.
Scaling with Windows has never been a problem. I know that Windows is
fully capable. I know exactly how we are going to scale, and I know that
Rackspace will be a part of that.”

### A customer-focused approach

UpCounsel’s customer-focused approach is much like the [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) that
Rackspace has provided Blake over the years. “Rackspace blows me away
every time,” says Blake. “I think they have done an incredible job at
focusing on the customer. UpCounsel is similar, in that we care a lot
about our customers, and their success is our success. I often think
that Rackspace cares about my business almost as much as I do, which is
incredible.”

“I would absolutely recommend Rackspace to others,” Blake says. “They
have always impressed me with their Fanatical Support and responsiveness
to our needs. Nobody cares about my business as much as I do, but, if
there was anybody else that did—I think it’s somebody like Rackspace
that has a vested interest in my success. Because when I’m successful,
that helps Rackspace as well.”
