**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:** Employee insurance and benefit services

**CHALLENGES:** Spending too much time and money maintaining in-house email

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace
Email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/)
with BCC Archiving service

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Eliminated daily email maintenance tasks and
dramatic reduction in spam

### Email Takes Up Too Much Time

Five years ago, Arthur (“Bo”) Villemain took the helm of the family
business his father founded almost 25 years prior. Soon thereafter, Bo
realized he was spending too much time and money dealing with problems
involving their internal email system and not enough time providing the
best possible service to their clients across the country and growing
the business.

He states, “It was taking an inordinate amount of time for something
that seems relatively simple – providing email for my employees. The
constant upkeep of spam filters and virus filters, the addition and
deletion of email accounts, as well as, the upkeep of the hardware to do
all of that was taking way too much time.”

### Problem Solved in One Day

When Bo experienced a particularly frustrating day, he knew he needed to
outsource his email system. He searched online for email service and
found Rackspace instantly. Bo chose Rackspace Email with BCC Archiving
service.

He gets free mobile sync tools, monthly backups of email data, and large
10GB mailboxes for just $2 per month. With Rackspace’s low pricing and
promise of unconditional support, the decision to switch to Rackspace
and the move to the new system were made easily and swiftly in one day.
And he hasn’t looked back.

### Rackspace Reduces Email Complexity and Saves Time

After deciding to go with Rackspace, Bo noticed improvements
immediately. There were no viruses arriving through email anymore and
spam was significantly reduced. He reports spending almost no time
dealing with email issues. Where he used to spend time every day
handling email problems, now it’s “maybe once a month” and is purely
administrative according to Bo.

Referring to Rackspace’s [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) team, the
CEO states that the customer service is excellent. He adds, “On the rare
occasion I have a problem with email, I get a response from Rackspace’s
***Fanatical Support*** team within an hour and the problem is solved in a
business day.”

As for pricing, Bo describes it as insignificant. “It’s not even a bill
I notice. For the price, it just doesn’t make any sense not to outsource
my email hosting to Rackspace,” Bo explains.

Speaking of the company’s three years of experience with the Rackspace
service, Bo remarks, “It’s been simple. It just works.”
