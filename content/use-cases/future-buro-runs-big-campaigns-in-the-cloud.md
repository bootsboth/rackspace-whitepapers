**The digital creative studio finds reliability, scalability, and support on
Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Cloud Sites<sup>&trade;</sup>**

**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:**  [Future Büro](http://futureburo.com/) is a digital
creative studio based in Sydney, Australia, that works with a number of
advertising agencies to build sites and products for high-profile clients such
as Red Bull, Coca-Cola, Amatil, and Virgin Mobile.

**CHALLENGES:**
Viral campaigns created traffic spikes other hosts couldn’t withstand,
and the Australian team was up at all hours making sure their American
clients’ sites stayed up.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Cloud
Sites](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/sites/) for
clients and campaigns of all sizes, providing peace of mind, uptime, and
support.

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** The company can focus on building great sites and
products without worrying whether campaign success will cause crashes. Staff
can also take vacations and sleep without fear that a client’s site is down.

Founded in 2008, Future Büro is a digital creative studio based in
Sydney, Australia. The company works with a number of advertising
agencies to build sites and products for high-profile clients such as
Red Bull, Coca-Cola Amatil, and Virgin Mobile.

Having had difficulties with shared hosting and VPS setups, Future Büro
decided it was time to move their sites into the cloud. [Rackspace Cloud
Sites](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/sites/)
offered the combination of reliability, scalability, and support Future
Büro needed, allowing their team to focus on building great sites,
rather than worrying about keeping them running.

### Relief from shared and VSP hosting frustration

Future Büro came to Rackspace after being frustrated by previous hosting
arrangements, says technical director Andrew Bateman. “When I started
here four years ago,” Bateman says, “shared hosting was not working out
great. We decided to move on to VPS.net and set up some servers there.”
It didn’t take long for them to regret their decision. “We were paying
for a managed plan, and we weren’t getting anything out of it,” Bateman
says. “That whole platform was unstable, so we had a lot of downtime,
and no one was able to reboot the servers. I kept having to jump online
to reboot servers—especially for our customers in the US—in the middle
of the night here in Sydney.”

Tired of midnight crashes, the company looked for a hosting option that
offered round-the-clock support and monitoring. Their search for
completely managed operations led them to do a test run with Rackspace
Cloud Sites. “It worked out fantastically,” Bateman says. The company
migrated all of their sites to [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/),
and they’ve been satisfied customers ever since.
 

### Reliability is the key

Since moving to Rackspace, Future Büro hasn’t had to worry about their
American customers’ sites crashing while they sleep. On the rare
occasions there is a problem, the company’s team at Rackspace is there
to take care of it. “It’s been very good,” Bateman says. “No system is
perfect, but for us, the important thing is that someone is there to
pick it back up again. For us, that’s bigger than uptime.”

Rackspace hasn’t only helped Bateman sleep easier. “With Rackspace, for
the first time in years I have been able to take a holiday without
having to worry that one of our sites would go down and stay down,” he
says. “If you put a site up, it’s going to stay up, and if doesn’t,
someone at Rackspace is already working to get it back up.”

### No-fear traffic spikes

Scalability is a major factor in Cloud Sites’ reliability. Because many
of Future Büro’s sites are tied to advertising campaigns, they needed a
host that could accommodate the kind of traffic a successful campaign
attracts. “Campaign sites are all about building a lot of traffic,”
Bateman says. “With Cloud Sites, we don’t have to think about it. If we
get a little bit of traffic, great. If we get a lot of traffic, even
better.”

 “Previously we had to do a lot of planning to upscale and handle the
traffic. Now I don’t even have to think about it,” Bateman says. Thanks
to Rackspace, going viral is a good thing, not a potential problem.

### Round-the-clock support

[***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)
service was a major attractor for Future Büro. Bateman’s favorite
feature is Live Chat. “I love jumping onto the Live Chat and getting a
response or a resolution immediately,” he says. “With the other provider
we used, it could be three or four hours before we got a response.”

Fanatical Support service allows Future Büro to focus on what’s
important: building great sites for their customers. “It means we can
spend our time thinking about the sites and products we are building,
rather than thinking about whether the site is going to stay up,”
Bateman says. “It’s good to know there’s going to be someone at the
other end of the line if we actually need to get in touch, which is not
something that a lot of hosting companies can say.”

### Peace of mind on the cloud

Since moving to Rackspace, Bateman has found other advantages to the
Cloud besides its reliability, scalability, and support. He’s especially
impressed with how little time it takes to get a site up and running.
“It’s very quick and easy to create a new site,” he says. “It takes just
ten minutes between creating the site and getting it live.”

Bateman is also pleased with the flexibility of Rackspace Cloud Sites.
“Being able to run a PHP, Apache, Linux, or .NET within the same
infrastructure is great for us,” he says. “It lets us keep all of our
sites together, instead of managing 20 different logins and different
providers. It makes it easy for us to handle clients using both Windows
and Linux.”

Overall, Future Büro’s been thoroughly satisfied with the Rackspace
experience. “Our experience on Cloud Sites has been great,” Bateman
says. “As a small company working with big brands, we don’t have the
time, money or manpower to set up and manage our own infrastructure to
deal with traffic spikes, OS security, staging environments, etc. [Cloud
Sites](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/sites/) has
made a real difference to our business.”
