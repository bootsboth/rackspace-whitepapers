### Tired of Babysitting Servers

Described as the Dolby Sound of electrocardiography, Monebo Technologies
doesn’t build products. Their signal processing technologies go into the
equipment used to monitor and record the electrical activity of the
heart. With employees spread across the United States, Ukraine, and
Russia, reliable communication is a necessity. “We needed the peace of
mind of knowing that email was running even if I wasn’t at home to
babysit the server,” says Dale Misczynski, President of Monebo
Technologies.

“We bought Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Small Business Server 2003 and I ran it
out of my house,” he says, “then there were a few issues where I’d left town
and a power outage struck, stopping mail delivery. It left us without
email until I returned to fix it.” He recalls that running the server
wasn’t a big deal but, without dedicated IT to support it, maintaining
around-the-clock coverage was a challenge, and they still needed to use
a local company to tend to the server when major issues arose.
Email-related tasks also took him away from the business focus. “I
handled BlackBerry setups too and because it’s not something I do every
day, it would take time to figure out,” Dale says. Monebo Technologies
needed a “hands-off” email system they could trust to work without
constant attention.

### Choice Driven by a Trusted Referral

Around the same time, Dale’s son made the switch to Rackspace for his
company, after spending a week recovering from an email-borne virus
attack. “After listening to my son rave about his experience with
Rackspace, the choice was a no-brainer,” Dale explains. After speaking
with Sales Engineer, Mikel Mendoza, he recalls, “I was impressed with
his knowledge and professionalism. It was perfect for us, and I was able
to make my decision on the phone.”

He selected Hosted Microsoft Exchange with BES<sup>&reg;</sup> and
ActiveSync<sup>&reg;</sup> to support their business needs. Microsoft Exchange
hosting turns the cost and time-prohibitive nature of the Exchange platform
into an easy-to-use, affordable service. The Rackspace applications suite
includes other email-related services, like mobile and archiving, so
customers can avoid using multiple vendors to support email service.
With powerful spam and virus protection from Rackspace, he’ll never have
to worry about an email-borne attack like the one his son suffered.
Backed by around-the-clock Fanatical Support, Dale can contact Rackspace
anytime he has a question or needs help with his email.

“Setup was easy. It took some time but it wasn’t a technical challenge,”
he says of transitioning his email data to Rackspace.

### Rackspace Eliminates Email Worries

There’s one less thing to worry about at Monebo these days – email
service. “Rackspace gave us peace of mind and saved us time,” says Dale.
The intuitive [Control Panel
dashboard](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/control_panel/) lives up to its
reputation, according to Dale, when he states, “The Control Panel is
fairly simple to use and doesn’t take a lot of learning.” From the
web-based Control Panel, customers can log in and add or remove users,
manage spam settings, grant mobile licenses, and more. The centralized
Control Panel manages all of your Rackspace applications all in one
place. That means that even if he’s on vacation, Dale can quickly log in
and manage his email.

Dale’s favorite feature? “We use BlackBerrys and iPhones<sup>&reg;</sup>.
Rackspace works well with both devices,” he says. Having access to their email
accounts from any Internet connection means they can receive and react
to critical information quicker, whether they are on the road or in the
office.

“Of the online vendors we use, Rackspace’s customer service is the
best,” says Dale. With access to ***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***, any
information or assistance he needs with his email is only a phone call or click
away. The ***Fanatical Support*** team gives customers the responsiveness and
accessibility of an onsite IT team. As an example, Dale relates a situation
when the Fanatical Support team stepped in to help them set up new addresses,
“When we needed help, they logged into our computers, and pretty much did it
for us.”

The prime benefit for Dale was not in money saved over buying equipment
or time saved from email maintenance. “The greatest benefit to me is
peace of mind. Knowing that there’s a team of experts to keep our email
constantly up and running is outstanding,” says Dale.
