### COMPANY OVERVIEW

Around a decade ago, entrepreneur Luke Peters was brainstorming ideas
for an e-business when he noticed an interesting trend in online keyword
searches. “At the time, most on-line businesses were focused on
electronics,” Peters says. “But it happened to be summer, and one of the
hot search terms was ‘air conditioner.’ So I decided to go against the
grain and sell portable appliances.”

The rest, as they say, is history. The company Peters founded, Air &
Water, Inc. ([www.Air-N-Water.com](http://www.air-n-water.com/)), began
with a modest line of air conditioners. Today, it is one of the
Internet’s largest independent appliance retailers, with a full catalog
of residential heating and cooling systems, purification products and
home appliances.

Peters attributes his company’s success to a combination of factors. One
is consumers’ increased willingness to purchase household items from
online storefronts. Another is the company’s strategic decision to
expand its catalog to include products like wine coolers.

But equally important is Air & Water’s commit- ment to website
reliability—something it achieved by hosting its servers with Rackspace.

### NOT A SINGLE UNPLANNED OUTAGE

Air & Water wasn’t always a Rackspace customer. When it first opened its
cyber doors in 2002, it ran its website on an in-house server. The
server ran fine, but there were chronic issues with its T1 line. “Our T1
was really unreliable,” says Adam Hart, IT Manager, Air & Water. “We
kept getting knocked offline for an hour or more at a time. And for an
e-commerce company, that is death.”

To make matters worse, the line was owned by one company but leased to
another. As a result, it was never entirely clear which vendor should be
held accountable for the service’s recurring connectivity issues. “It
seemed like we could never get a straight answer about what was going
on,” Hart says. “This was a mission critical piece of our business, and
I never felt comfortable with the quality of support we were getting. It
was frustrating.”

It was an unsustainable situation. As an e-commerce company, Air & Water
depends on its web applications for the vast majority of its sales
transactions. And during peaks in its sales cycles—when seasonal changes
in the weather spark demand for air conditioners or portable heaters,
for instance—the company processes thousands of dollars’ worth of
business every hour.

So Air & Water began looking at managed hosting. “We knew we were going
to need more bandwidth anyway,” Hart says. “We were also outgrowing our
server. So rather than buying all new hardware and adding another T1
line, we decided to outsource.”

The company considered a number of managed hosting providers. It quickly
realized that Rackspace was the strongest contender. “We wanted to go
with an established company,” Hart says. “With Rackspace, we knew we had
a hosting provider that will be around for the long term.”

Moving its [web
applications](http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise_hosting/saas/) to a
Rackspace environment resulted in an immediate improvement in Air &
Water’s website availability. “We have not had a single unplanned outage
since we moved to Rackspace,” Hart notes. “Our website is now up and
running around the clock.”

### FANATICAL SUPPORT DELIVERS PEACE OF MIND

The reliable hardware and connectivity delivered by Rackspace hosting
certainly solved Air & Water’s most critical business requirement. But
the company’s relationship with Rackspace has delivered other benefits
as well.

Rackspace monitors Air & Water’s website, for example, pinging it every
five minutes to make sure it is up. “I no longer have to worry about the
server going down in the middle of the night,” Hart says. “We have
around-the-clock monitoring without the expense of having someone on
staff to watch our site 24 x 7.”

When Air & Water added another server to its infrastructure, Hart adds,
“Rackspace helped us upgrade while staying within our budget. It’s
another way their customer service has been amazing.”

And any time Hart has had specific technical questions, Rackspace has
proved to be an invaluable resource. “The Rackspace support team goes
above and beyond anything I’d expect,” Hart says. “They advertise that
they offer [Fanatical Support](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/),
and they do.”

As the Air & Water CEO, Peters also cites Rackspace support as one of
the key benefits of the company’s relationship. “Rackspace Fanatical
Support gives me peace of mind,” Peters says. “I know that if we ever
experience an issue, Rackspace will be right there to fix it. As a
business owner, that is exactly what I was looking for—and with
Rackspace, it’s what we got.”
