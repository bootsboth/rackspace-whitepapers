### Company Overview

Pennsylvania-based BankersEdge has relied on Rackspace for the past
three years to provide its award-winning [Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/), 100
percent guaranteed network uptime, 24x7x365 live technical support and
[Intensive Windows-expertise](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/windows/server2012/)
to ensure they can continue to provide quality, online training to a
breadth of customers. Now BankersEdge will rely on Rackspace to keep
operations running, even in the event of a disaster, through Rackspace's
disaster recovery solution.

### Situation

In today's fast paced banking environment, and ever changing federal
regulations, financial institutions cannot spare time to develop quality
training courses for their employees. However, these training courses
are critical for employees to better understand their company's policies
and procedures as well as updated regulatory changes. So to make sure
their employees get this crucial training without the worry and hassle
of developing it internally, these financial institutions turn to
BankersEdge.

More than 1,200 financial institutions rely on BankersEdge for quality,
online retail banking training courses. Their in-depth training covers
regulatory compliance, banking fundamentals, product knowledge, and
service and selling skills. BankersEdge offers a diverse selection of
more than 220 fully customizable courses. Involving real world examples
and interactive case studies, these courses are flexible, easily
navigated and much more fun and engaging than clicking through a
standard PowerPoint presentation.

For more than seven years BankersEdge has provided these courses,
completely customized toward each individual institution's own
terminology, policy and procedures, and even business style. The
company's Management Administration and Reporting System (MARS) allows
customers a flexible and easy-to-use reporting tool to track progress
and results. All courses are available across the Internet or deployed
remotely on a customer's Learning Management System. This makes it easy
for employees to load onto their desktop and complete when convenient.

This being said, network uptime is essential to BankersEdge's continued
growth and success of delivering quality online training. With any
downtime, BankersEdge loses credibility with its customers.

"BankersEdge prides itself on delivering quality training," says Jeff
Kirkell, chief technical architect, BankersEdge. "Our service is geared
toward banks and financial institutions, so we strive to ensure our
content is understandable and effective, and we rely on Rackspace to
deliver this service with 100 percent uptime so it can be accessed
anytime, day or night."

Prior to hosting with Rackspace, BankersEdge had a few servers in a
collocation facility in Florida. With the collocation facility, they
were personally responsible for all the server upkeep and
administration. "We were perfectly capable of keeping the servers up and
running, but it wasn't part of our core business," says Kirkell. "It was
taking too much time and manpower away from our revenue-generating focus
of creating and distributing quality online training."

In 2003, BankersEdge created a new version of their existing application
and decided to find a hosting provider with managed hosting solutions to
take the reigns. After looking at three or four other providers, they
decided on Rackspace.

"When looking for a hosting provider, the most important thing we were
looking for was network uptime," says Kirkell. "Rackspace guaranteed 100
percent network uptime, along with its service offerings and outstanding
support, made them the best choice." BankersEdge started with just one
server at Rackspace but within eight months had added three more,
upgraded to a larger database, then added a second database and a load
balancer.

### Solution

BankersEdge has experienced a 30 percent growth, per year, over the past
three years. Along with a growing company comes a growing list of
clientele. To ensure their website can handle the growing traffic,
BankersEdge has continued to upgrade its infrastructure within
Rackspace. Today, they have four HP DL385 web servers running Windows
2003, two HP DL385 database servers running Windows 2003, managed
backup, a Pix 515R firewall, a load balancer, custom monitoring and SQL
Sage DBA service, all located in Rackspace's Virginia data center.

BankersEdge has relied on Rackspace ***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>*** to
make certain their courses and services are easily delivered online. So what
might happen if something outside of Rackspace control were to affect the
Virginia data center, and BankersEdge's application goes down?

To prevent BankersEdge from ever having to answer that question, they
turned to Rackspace for a disaster recovery solution. "Currently,
everything is in Rackspace's Virginia data center," says Kirkell.
"However unlikely, if something were to happen to that data center, we
could loose everything. Soon we are deploying a web server, database
server and firewall in Rackspace's Dallas data center that can replicate
our data. Essentially, if something did happen to the Virginia data
center, within minutes, the Dallas server can support a significant
number of our customers."

### Benefits

However, Rackspace disaster recovery solution is not your typical 'hot
spare.' The geographically redundant database is not just sitting on a
rack in the data center, using up space and power, waiting for another
server to fail. During non-critical times, this database will be
utilized by BankersEdge. "We plan on moving our staging environment to
the database in Dallas, which will utilize replication and data
mirroring," says Kirkell. "It also gives us a tremendous amount of
backup and redundancy that we have never had before."

With the flip of a switch, BankersEdge's disaster recovery database can
be up and running in a matter of minutes. While a disaster recovery
solution is an added expense, the feeling of knowing that if something
unexpected happened, they will be able to continue with business as
usual until the emergency is fixed. By relying on Rackspace to provide
geographical redundancy, BankersEdge can avoid the headaches of always
wondering 'what if' and worry more about 'what next?'

BankersEdge is currently developing a new application they plan on
deploying later this year. "Another benefit of having that spare
database, we can test our new application against the hardware prior to
deploying it company wide," says Kirkell. "Rackspace has made it to
where our geographically redundant environment in Dallas can have so
many more functions than basic disaster recovery."

The disaster recovery database will be installed in March and within a
matter of weeks will be fully operational. BankersEdge presently hosts
its corporate data internally, but plans are in motion to back up some
of that data in the Dallas data center, with their ultimate goal to
offload as much internal data as possible to Rackspace.
