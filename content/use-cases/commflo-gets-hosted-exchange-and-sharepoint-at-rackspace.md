### Looking to the Clouds for Email and Collaboration Solutions

Nearly 13 years ago, Jay Kiley, President of Commflo, was recruiting
investors and overseeing development of innovative software for the
commercial lending industry. He was also dealing with maintaining an
on-premises Exchange server. “My time was better spent working on the
business, not troubleshooting Exchange or figuring out how to set up our
iPhones. The complexities of Exchange can be overwhelming. With so many
options, it was hard not to dive into the details and lose focus,” says
Jay.

Jay sees Commflo eventually adopting Microsoft Dynamics. As a result, he
wanted to find a solution that would both alleviate the Exchange burden
and integrate with the forthcoming upgrade. He was also looking for a
better way to manage document collaboration and team communication. Most
importantly, he wanted to build out enterprise-grade IT capabilities
without investing in hardware, software, and the resources to support it
all. “Even when I had a full-time employee managing the server, I
wondered if I was getting my money’s worth, and if they really knew all
of the intricacies and capabilities of Exchange. The focus was on moving
forward with the capabilities of Exchange and one individual is limited
vs. an entire team like Rackspace. We wanted a cloud-based solution. Our
company is built on our own cloud-based software that we license, as
well as internal solutions. I wanted to utilize the benefits of the
cloud so I could focus on growing the business,” he explains.

### Enterprise Applications without the Enterprise Price Tag

Acting on a referral, Jay investigated Rackspace’s hosted Microsoft
Exchange service. I was sold based on Fanatical Support, but Rackspace
releasing SharePoint<sup>&reg;</sup> was the tipping point. “That’s what made
me go with Rackspace. There’s nothing else out there like SharePoint, it
trumped all the other solutions we looked at,” according to Jay. With
the SharePoint and Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Exchange combination, Commflo
gets both an enterprise-level email service and a corporate portal. The cost
to implement expensive, complex systems, like SharePoint and Exchange can
run thousands of dollars upfront with ongoing maintenance costs that
seem overwhelming. The cost and long-term management commitment can make
it a cost-prohibitive proposition for businesses wanting to take full
advantage of team collaboration for focus, expertise, and support, while
implementing new solutions going forward. With Rackspace’s cloud-based
delivery model, Commflo was up and running quickly without spending
thousands or undertaking the ongoing expense of systems management.

With SharePoint, they can store, collaborate, and track shared
documents. “We just stood up SharePoint and are experimenting with
templates and setting up team sites. So far, we use it mainly for
version control on documents, announcements, team discussions and
links.,” says Jay. SharePoint’s document versioning features allow
multiple users to “check-in” and then “check-out” a document, which
prevents more than one person from working a document at the same time.
Each change or update made to the shared document is tracked. SharePoint
also includes file storage, content management, and enterprise search
capabilities. Because SharePoint offers seamless integration with
Office<sup>&reg;</sup> programs, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, users can
open Office documents from SharePoint, as well as save documents directly
from Office applications into SharePoint.

With Rackspace, each email account includes a free 250MB SharePoint site
with additional storage available as needed. This allows businesses to
experiment with SharePoint and find out how to best use it in their
business with no obligation.

### Gains Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup> and Loses the High Cost of On-Site Management

“The biggest benefit is unlimited 24/7 tech support. The service is
really more about the relationship. For us, Rackspace’s responsiveness
was the biggest selling point,” says Jay. The Fanatical Support promise
gives companies, like Commflo, the comfort of knowing that they can
reach technical expertise whenever they need it via phone, live chat, or
email. “Your support representatives have given me their personal phone
numbers and email addresses giving me the confidence of knowing how you
guys react when we need you. That confidence also adds to our ability to
ramp up quickly without turning back to figure out how to get new
employees set up or buying more hardware. We can plan for the future and
trust that the infrastructure will be there without investing more time
and money.”

Since moving his email to Rackspace and adding SharePoint, Jay
identifies multiple benefits. “We’ve saved thousands of dollars in just
the past sixty days. Paying a full-time tech an average of $100 an hour
alone has saved us money. The biggest savings was energy. Instead of
focusing on delivering another IT system, we can focus on optimizing
SharePoint and Exchange as business tools.” Another benefit with
Rackspace is the ability to consolidate services. For providers only
offering email, customers are forced to enlist a bevy of supplemental
providers for archiving, backup, or mobile. With Rackspace, Jay can get
his email and SharePoint from one provider, on one bill making vendor
management and support easier.

On a scale of 1-10, Jay gives Rackspace a 12. “It so much easier to pick
up the phone and get new accounts setup, and the features are easy for
users to figure out,” he reports. Of his overall experience, Jay says,
“Having the Rackspace team approach is much better than being the single
guy handling it all. There’s no going back.”
