### Company overview

Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) is an S&P 100 company and a
global leader in the retail real estate industry.<sup>1</sup> The company
currently owns or has an interest in more than 325 retail real estate
properties in North America and Asia comprising approximately 241
million square feet. SPG is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana and
employs approximately 5,500 people in the United States.

Simon.com was built for mall customers as a reference tool and an
ecommerce site, allowing users to check mall hours, search for deals at
specific retailers within malls, and consult mall maps in order to find
the locations of stores. The ecommerce portion of Simon.com offers gift
cards and a rewards program, where gift cards are sold individually and
in bulk.

### Handling Peak Holiday Traffic

Prior to moving Simon.com to Rackspace, SPG had a series of support and
technical challenges with its previous hosting provider. “The challenges
Simon.com was experiencing primarily concerned the reliability of the
sites environment and infrastructure,” explains Greg Grskovich, Senior
Systems Administrator, with SPG. “In addition to that, the support was a
big piece of it, as well.”

For SPG, it was crucial that Simon.com functioned properly when
customers came to visit during the holidays. “I can’t understate the
importance of uptime for our website,” says Grskovich. “We were on a
mission to have a successful holiday season, anticipating a 400 to 500
percent increase in peak traffic. We actually ended up seeing a 700
percent increase!”

### Reliable Infrastructure and Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>

In preparation for the 2012 holiday season, Rackspace worked closely
with SPG to understand their business and technical challenges. Given
the SPG mandate of delivering a highly reliable ecommerce experience
during peak load times, the solution for Simon.com placed an emphasis on
excellent [SQL
Server](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/web-hosting/mysql/)
performance. The resulting infrastructure includes a combination of
physical and virtualized dedicated hardware, with clustered databases
running on Rackspace top performance tier of shared EMC VMAX storage.

SPG is quick to point out that the infrastructure is only one ingredient
behind their success with Simon.com. The other is [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/).
“The level of support from Rackspace made all the difference in terms of the
site staying up,” says Grskovich. “The Rackspace support team went the extra
mile in order to make Simon.com a reliable place. As a result of moving
to Rackspace, we had a successful holiday season, possibly our first
successful holiday season ever, and Rackspace was really a key part of
that for us.”

“In terms of our online persona, the partnership with Rackspace has
brought reliability to our website,” says Grskovich. “When people come
to our website during the busiest, highest traffic periods of the year,
our site is up and functioning. Rackspace has helped us produce a
reliable product for the users.”

### A Hybrid Solution in the Future

Since migrating to Rackspace, SPG has built out what they consider to be
a reliable and [PCI
compliant](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/pci/) website. And
Grskovich is pleased to say, “We are now running a stable online
environment, our relationship with Rackspace is well established, and
we’ve developed a good rapport with our support team. Now, it’s time to
start evaluating the future of our environment.”

Does a [hybrid hosting solution](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/)
make sense for Simon Properties Group? Grskovich concludes, “Simon
Properties is generally very pleased with Rackspace at this point in
time. We’re familiar with what
[RackConnect](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/rackconnect/)
is, and we are ready to begin evaluating the feasibility of moving our
front-end systems into the public cloud. With a hybrid solution, the
ease of administration and the potential of being able to scale quicker
than we are able to today makes sense.”
