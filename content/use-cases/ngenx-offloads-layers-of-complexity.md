**nGenx reduced capital expenditures and gained back the freedom to
focus on their sweet spot, while trusting Rackspace with their hosting
needs to keep the lights on.**

When vetting the benefits between an on-premise solution or a [Hosted
Virtual Desktop (HVD)](http://www.rackspace.com/hostedvirtualdesktop/)
service provider like Rackspace, [nGenx](http://www.ngenx.com/) chose to
throw in their lot with [Rackspace® Hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/)
because it not only reduced their time-to-market, but also allowed them
to free up resources to focus on application delivery, rather than
infrastructure.

“We aren’t in the infrastructure business,” said Dave Gibson, Chief
Operating Office of nGenx, “but Rackspace is. It makes sense to go to
the leader in the industry, so my team can go deeper into their fields
of expertise in application delivery.”

Since its founding in 2000, nGenx has been exploring new technology and
opportunities which enhance the deployment of their application delivery
service. Through a unique Partner Program, nGenx is able to host
line-of-business applications coupled with other Productivity
solutions.

One of the deciding factors for choosing Rackspace versus other data
center options was the quick turn around with regard to the scaling of
hardware infrastructure according to Gibson. By deploying on Rackspace
gear, Gibson and team avoided the timely process of buying and building
the necessary equipment within their own data center, effectively
reducing not only the amount of time he would have to invest, but also
the purchasing cycle. Gibson says that ease of deployment was a great
value-add on top of the many benefits of hosting with Rackspace.

With Rackspace, nGenx is able to grow their cloud print quickly.
Spinning servers up and down based on capacity demands allows them the
flexibility to run their business successfully without the constant
unknown costs looming. Though nGenx maintains a data center that hosts
many of their applications, the choice to offload certain components
into trusted service provider’s data center fit into their business
model. Outsourcing the high demand components has pushed the team to
look at which layers of their platform will work more efficiently in a
scalable data center rather than their own. Gibson can think more
strategically about a long-term plan to evolve their current data usage,
rather that inundating their resources with products that are better
suited in offsite gear.

Gibson says he has confidence in the infrastructure and also the brand
of Rackspace, which he believes lends confidence to his customers.

“Rackspace is synonymous with hosting and scale,” said Gibson. “By
leveraging Microsoft, Citrix and Rackspace and our ability to offer
legitimate licensing for all of the apps that we host, I believe we have
created a ‘best of breed’ product suite for our customers.”

As a member of the [Rackspace Partner
Program](http://www.rackspace.com/partners/), nGenx benefits from the
leads and referrals that flow both ways. Gibson says that though he
thinks sales will benefit in the long-term, he is also pleased with the
short-term advantages seen by his operations team. By removing one layer
of complexity, more time is freed up to work on projects that benefit
the whole of the company, rather than spending time in the stacks
working on the daily maintenance.

Gibson visited the Rackspace office before choosing to host with them;
the visit was proof of the exceptional customer service, branded
[***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/),
he had heard so much about.

“My support team at Rackspace sets the correct expectation and delivers
a path to resolution. When I get someone on the phone, they care about
my problem, and if they don’t know the answer immediately, they leave me
with a plan of action to find that answer,” said Gibson.

nGenx strives to provide customers with consistency and reliability,
making each interaction personable rather than just a process. That
desire to provide customer satisfaction at every turn is mirrored by the
efforts of Rackspace as both organizations work together to provide
solutions they can be proud of.
