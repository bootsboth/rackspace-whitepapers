### Company Overview

Six Red Marbles is an award-winning provider of educational solutions
for the K-12 market. Their organization began developing educational
software in 1996 and through key partnerships they integrated content,
print, and technology to extend their reach to a variety of educational
materials for students and teachers.

This year, Six Red Marbles introduced their own Natural Learning System
that integrates the latest neuroscientific research with traditional
teaching methods and interactive delivery designed to engage and inspire
students. They expect a large demand for this service.

### The Need

With 24 production Cloud Servers in use, Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> does 100% of
Six Red Marbles’ offsite hosting. High concurrent usage required for some
sites makes remote environments inefficient and cost prohibitive for
now.

### The Solution

“For a long time, we’ve been looking for a good hosting provider for our
applications and a place to store our environments,” says Roy O’Neill,
Technical Director at Six Red Marbles. “Traditional locations require a
lot of upfront costs and build-outs. Rackspace provided an alternative
solution: the ability to build out and scale out as big as you want—not
just vertically, but horizontally. Six Red Marbles is using not only
Rackspace Cloud solutions, but also their email, resale packages, and in
the past used the Managed solutions as well.”

Roy confidently stated that they “have and will be moving everything to
the Rackspace Cloud.” Why the cloud? Roy defined success in his
infrastructure as uptime, quick recovery, and low cost—all features he
firmly believes the cloud, and Rackspace specifically, can offer his
organization.

### The Success

“For the past two years, we’ve been using the Rackspace environment
pretty heavily,” says O’Neill. “We’ve moved 90% of our environment to
Rackspace Cloud solutions and used Cloud Servers with a Managed
Operations under the beta program. These solutions have not only been
progressively getting better — and they were great to begin with — but
all the solutions we’ve looked for and requested are either on the
roadmap or have already been fixed.”

“By using Rackspace, it has allowed me to save so much,” says O’Neill.
“The traditional method of building an environment would normally be to
purchase above your initial need. If the need goes away, you are stuck
with the purchase you made. If you have a growth spurt and didn’t
properly plan ahead, you end up with additional costs and downtime.
Rackspace solves this for me.”

O’Neill explained that using the Rackspace Cloud positively influences
the bottom line of his organization. Depending on need, Six Red Marbles
can add or subtract resources to their configuration and realize the
cost adjustments in real time, instead of months later. “I love dynamic
products and I love dynamic pricing,” he says.

“The Rackspace Cloud really shines with the ability to build out
additional servers and development environments,” says O’Neill. “If we
were doing this on dedicated servers, it would cost us a lot more.” He
concludes, “We love having the cloud environment and the ability to
scale up and down very easily, both horizontally and vertically, and
paying only for what we use. Having 24/7 access to your Managed
Operations on top of that would be a godsend to any company that works
in the cloud. For Six Red Marbles, it’s been an awesome solution.”
