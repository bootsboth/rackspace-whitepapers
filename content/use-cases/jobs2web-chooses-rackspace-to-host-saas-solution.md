### Company Overview

A SaaS solution providing an interactive, web-based recruitment
marketing platform for Fortune 500 companies which enables them to
optimize recruiting channels and find, engage and manage high quality
candidates at a lower cost.

### Benefits

A Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Hybrid Hosting environment combining Private Cloud,
dedicated database servers and disaster recovery enables Jobs2web to
concentrate on creating and selling their recruitment solutions rather
than investing resources in building and maintaining IT infrastructure
and staff.

“Rackspace has been key to our success as a SaaS company primarily
because they allow us to focus on the business of creating great
software for our clients.” Peter Jacoby, CTO, Jobs2web

The Rackspace private cloud plus dedicated hosting solution helps
Job2web deliver an outstanding customer experience.

### Company Overview

Founded in 2003, Jobs2web helps organizations hire better people, more
quickly, and more cost effectively by enabling its clients to develop,
manage, and harvest Web recruiting channels. This increases the quality
in the talent pipeline and lowers recruiting costs.

Jobs2web offers an award-winning integrated Software as a Service (SaaS)
solution called the Recruitment Marketing Platform (RMP). The platform
delivers the infrastructure necessary to automate the recruiting
process: delivering potential talent from multiple recruiting channels;
capturing and converting them into candidates; interacting with
candidates in the online communities where they gather; and measuring
all important metrics throughout the talent supply chain. The platform
includes the award-winning Recruiting DashboardTM that provides the
metrics necessary to optimize recruiting dollar spend and drive down
cost per hire.

Other Jobs2web solutions help customers establish new recruiting
channels, including Social Network Recruiting, Mobile Recruiting,
Employee Referral Marketing, and Recruitment Process Outsourcing 2.0.

### The Situation

In 2008, as a very lean 28-person SaaS company, Jobs2web ran its own
infrastructure in-house. Desiring to spend its valuable resources and
focus on creating a next-generation Web-based talent recruiting platform
that would meet the exacting performance and scalability requirements of
Fortune 500 companies rather than building its own IT operations
infrastructure and staff, they began a search for a hosting provider.

Jobs2web was seeking a provider that could deliver a cost-effective, yet
high performance and secure IT environment that takes advantage of
leading-edge cloud and dedicated hosting technology. Finally, and
equally important, Jobs2web wanted a hosting provider that shared its
passion for delivering an outstanding customer experience and be there
for Jobs2web 24x7x365.

### Rackspace Solution

Initially drawn to Rackspace by its position in the hosting industry, 24x7x365,
[***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/),
and monitoring services, Jobs2web turned to Rackspace for a turnkey SaaS
application delivery environment that combined private cloud flexibility
and performance with dedicated MS-SQL database servers.

“The ability to mix your dedicated and cloud hardware in a hybrid
environ- ment is a really exciting offering and a perfect mix of
dedicated and private cloud—it lets you go into cloud in stages,” said
Peter Jacoby, CTO, Jobs2web.

Jobs2web runs both Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> and Linux<sup>&reg;</sup> with
virtual VMware pre-production environments and production frontend servers,
which are also load balanced along with dedicated MS-SQL database servers. They
have also added a second-site disaster recovery solution. Their
Rackspace team understood their complex disaster recovery requirements,
helped to architect a DR solution that met their technical and financial
requirements, and built, implemented, and tested the solution all within
a very aggressive five-month time frame.

And to give Jobs2web the level of support they wanted in order to
provide their customers the best possible experience, Rackspace
delivered its Intensive<sup>&reg;</sup> services.

The Intensive SLA offers not only a 100% Network Uptime Guarantee and
1-hour Hardware Replacement Guarantee; it also provides guarantees
around a set of fundamental services.

### The Success

By selecting Rackspace as their SaaS hosting provider, Jobs2web has been
able to focus on building their business rather than on building IT
infrastructure. As a result, their business has grown significantly.
Rackspace provides scalability as Jobs2web sustains traffic growth
increases of 10% per month and a tenfold growth in devices under
management. In addition, through the use of Rackspace private cloud,
Jobs2web can run more servers at lower cost with dramatically more
flexibility. This includes the ability to utilize resources in their
multi-purpose DR facility as pre-production environments.

Rackspace continues to work with Jobs2web to provide infrastructure and
technical support to their IT department. In addition to providing and
running their entire SaaS hosting infrastructure, Rackspace has the
hosting specialists so Jobs2web doesn’t have to have them on staff.

“When we were ready for virtualization, Rackspace was there. When we
were ready for SAN, Rackspace was there. No additional vendor selection
necessary. And, you have your dedicated account manager ready to work
with you.”

### Customer's Final Words

”Rackspace has been much more than just a managed hosting provider for
us,” explained Jacoby. “They share our values and our commitment to
providing the best possible customer experience. And they demonstrate
that every day through their focus on providing Fanatical Support. They
are always there when we need them. In addition, Rackspace delivers
innovative IT services including hybrid solutions of private cloud and
dedicated hosting that make our infrastructure highly scalable and more
efficient, without sacrificing reliability and performance. Finally,
they have contributed to our growth with their credibility as we sell
our services to Fortune 500 companies. When we say to global
multinational companies that we’re hosting with Rackspace, problems go
away. Knowing we’re hosting with Rackspace gives them peace of mind.”
