### Company overview

Based in New Zealand, Xero is a provider of online accounting software.
With hosting partner Rackspace, it is in the process of upgrading to
Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> SQL Server 2012 to take advantage of scalability and
availability improvements. By [hosting SQL Server 2012 with
Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/database/mssql/ "SQL Server Hosting "),
Xero gets on-demand scalability, high-performing code that runs more
reliably, and a true business partner that takes care of infrastructure
concerns so that it can focus on its business.

software program for small and midsize businesses and individuals. Based
in Wellington, New Zealand, with offices worldwide, the firm employs
nearly 200 people.

### Solution Spotlight

-   Can easily scale online offering to accommodate terrific business growth
-   Can create more efficient code, which improves developer productivity and
code performance
-   Free to focus on the business rather than infrastructure worries

### Business Needs

New Zealand software maker Xero is extremely ambitious: it wants to be
the world leader in online accounting software—and it’s making good
progress. The company’s namesake product, aimed at chartered accountants
and small to midsize businesses, is gaining devotees by the day. The
company’s customer base has grown beyond Asia Pacific to the United
Kingdom and the United States. From 2010 to 2011, Xero more than doubled
both its revenues—from NZ$9.3 million (US$7 million) to more than
NZ$19 million (US$14.5 million)—and its customer base, from 36,000 to
more than 78,000.

With its customer count doubling annually, Xero has to scale its IT
platform rapidly and continuously. Xero has hosted its product with
Rackspace since 2008 and has always used Microsoft SQL Server 2008
Enterprise data management software as its database engine. Rackspace is
a US-based hosting and cloud computing provider that delivers hosting
services to businesses around the world.

By early 2012, Xero had 50 servers in two Rackspace data centers—in
Dallas, Texas, and in Chicago, Illinois—including two SQL Server
clusters. All were Dell PowerEdge R710 and R810 servers running the
Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system. Xero began encountering
scalability limits with its existing storage area network (SAN) and
needed to upgrade. Upgrading storage made it a good time to also upgrade
the database software.

### Solution

“We want to keep up with the latest features in SQL Server,” says Paul
Rushworth, Platform Manager at Xero. “Some of the features in SQL Server
2012 support higher availability and scalability, which would let us
fail over databases more seamlessly and also test new product features
more easily. Upgrading to SQL Server 2012 would help us improve our
resilience and response.”

Xero began evaluating SQL Server 2012 in April 2012, with special
interest in the SQL Server 2012 AlwaysOn feature. With it, Xero can
treat a group of databases as a single entity called an Availability
Group and fail over a group of databases as a single unit. By using
AlwaysOn, Xero will be able to set up an active/active/passive
configuration for its databases, which will deliver greater availability
and enable easier testing of new features.

Xero is also exploring SQL Server 2012 enhancements to the T-SQL
(Transact SQL) language. Some of these enhancements ease the transition
to SQL Server from other languages and platforms and others provide new
ways to solve database problems. “Our product makes extensive use of
T-SQL, so these improvements will help our developers write more
efficient, high-performing code,” Rushworth says.

Xero’s main production database contains roughly five terabytes of data
and serves nearly 80,000 customers. With Rackspace, Xero can continue
expanding its customers and data stores without scalability or
infrastructure concerns. For example, when Xero needed to upgrade its
SAN, Rackspace researched the best option. Xero plans to have production
workloads running on SQL Server 2012 by October 2012.

### Benefits

By upgrading to SQL Server 2012 and hosting with Rackspace, Xero can
gain the scalability it needs to accommodate fierce business growth,
create higher-performing code, and focus on its business rather than
infrastructure concerns.

#### Scale Easily to Accommodate Business Growth

Xero is doubling in size annually, and SQL Server 2012 and Rackspace are
key enablers of that growth. “By hosting SQL Server 2012 with Rackspace,
we have the scalability we need to spin up databases very quickly and
cost-effectively, thanks to the cloud delivery model,” Rushworth says.
“No matter how much our customer base and databases grow, we’re ready.”

Xero is adding a database node every two to three months and plans to
double its storage shortly. By working with Rackspace, Xero does not
have to incur the capital expenditure and pain of performing a SAN
upgrade itself; Rackspace takes care of every inch of the
infrastructure.

Additionally, by taking advantage of US Rackspace data centers, Xero can
also take advantage of [US-based Rackspace
employees](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/), who are hard
at work while Xero employees sleep. “We have a growing global customer
base, so Rackspace’s global presence is a huge asset,” says Rushworth.

#### Create Higher-Performing Code

By using the improvements to T-SQL, the Xero development team can write
more efficient code, which not only improves developer productivity but
increases product performance and availability.

“Once in production, we expect to see query speed performance
improvements, which gives customers a better experience using our
product,” Rushworth says. “We can expand our business globally while
maintaining very high performance and outstanding customer response
times.”

#### Focus on Business Rather than Infrastructure

In Rackspace, Xero has far more than a hosting provider; it has a
trusted business partner. “Our ambition is to be the world’s best small
business accounting solution, so we need to be with the top hosting
provider—and today, that’s Rackspace,” Rushworth says. “Our business
wouldn’t exist if we’d had to create a comparable infrastructure on
premise. Rackspace is a true partner and a core part of our operational
team. They research and invest in the latest technology so we don’t have
to. It makes our job not only easier but more pleasant.”
