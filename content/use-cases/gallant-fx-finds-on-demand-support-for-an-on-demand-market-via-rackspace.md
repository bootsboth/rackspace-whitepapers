**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:** Finanacial services

**CHALLENGES:** Infrastructure to withstand strenuous demand and
dependable uptime

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Dedicated
servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/),
[monitoring](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/monitoring/), and
[Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Seamless migration with the ability to maintain
operations needed to trade trillions of dollars traded a day

### Company Overview

The Foreign Exchange Market (Forex) is one of the largest and oldest
markets existing. According to the Bank for International Settlements,
average daily trading in the global foreign exchange markets is
estimated at $3.21 trillion. Brokers are constantly buying and selling
24 hours a day, 5 days a week. They need to be continuously connected to
view, monitor and trade in real time.

In this volatile market, every second of downtime can cost thousands of
dollars. Gallant FX needed the infrastructure that could withstand this
strenuous demand and provide dependable network uptime. They found that
and much more at Rackspace.

### SITUATION

Gallant FX Inc. is a Foreign Exchange liquidity provider that offers a
wide range of trading technologies and services in a unique Forex
Trading environment. Gallant VPS can be accessed on different operating
systems—anytime, anywhere by hundreds of traders. MetaTrader is a
trusted online trading platform designed for financial institutions
dealing with Forex, Contracts for Difference (CFD) and futures market,
and is used by hundreds of brokerage companies and banks worldwide.

One of the key benefits of using MetaTrader is script writing
capabilities for automated trading called Expert Advisors. Expert
Advisors (EA) are algorithms written by developers that enable trades to
be placed on the MetaTrader without the user’s assistance. It is
essentially a robot trading a client’s account according to the
parameters that are set. A VPS creates a unique environment allowing the
robot to trade up to 24 hours a day without MetaTrader running on a
client’s PC.

One setback EA developers experience is pirating of software. If
security measures are not met, especially in a Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>
Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> Operating System, hackers can easily access code.
Gallant runs on a UNIX environment. They chose a UNIX hosting server over a
Microsoft operating system, because anyone with an internet connection can
directly access their own MetaTrader platform, whether they’re running on Mac
OSX, Windows or even their iPhone. Not only is it accessible, it is also safe.

“Customers are safe from IP theft and other software security issues
found in the Windows Operating System (commonly found with all other VPS
providers),” said Simon Grunfeld, President and CTO of Gallant FX Inc.
“Whereas stealing someone’s IP is easy to do on a Window’s platform,
it’s impossible to do on Gallant. There are a lot of pirated copies of
these trading robots floating around on the Internet, but Gallant is the
safest.”

Security isn’t the only issue for brokers in the Forex market. With
trillions of dollars traded per day, 100% uptime is crucial and can make
or break a business. End-users need constant live access to monitor and
execute trades. Gallant FX needed a provider that is proven to be
trusted, reliable and user-friendly. They also needed the hardware that
would withstand heavy demand. “We needed a lot of handholding in the
beginning. We had some software knowledge in-house but lacked the
networking and equipment,” Grunfeld explained.

Failed attempts to co-locate and host with lower-end hosting providers
eventually led them to Rackspace. But it took several issues and
incidents to finally motivate them to make the switch. Servers crashed
because they couldn’t handle the load. Upgrades were lacking and
required slow turnarounds. Hours were wasted trying to deal with
customer support. Gallant’s clients needed a name they could trust when
it came to hosting. With Rackspace, they found a home for their
application that they and their customers could count on.

### SOLUTION

Gallant FX came online with Rackspace in November of 2008 and
immediately found itself in need of rapid scaling abilities. They
started with a simple configuration and within the same afternoon found
themselves needing more servers. Gallant placed a call to their
Rackspace Support Team, who quickly coordinated a move in the data
center to accommodate their needs. A day ahead of schedule, the data
center move was completed with no interruption.The following day,
Gallant requested three more servers for additional scale. Rackspace
realized the rate of growth Gallant was experiencing was exceptional,
and within 36 hours, the 3-server deployment was completed—from
conception to online.

Gallant FX has large plans for the future that include Rackspace. On the
horizon are aspirations to build mainstream platforms beyond MetaTrader
and aggregation quote engines. In the immediate future, they have an
important project lined up. This January, Gallant FX will be the
technology sponsor for [“Man vs.
Machine,”](http://www.manversusmachine.net/) a Forex trading contest
that pits humans against automated trading bots. This ten-week
competition will simultaneously run thousands of automated trading
systems (Machine) and manual trades by hand (Man) to see who earns the
most. With over a thousand developers and trading systems running on its
infrastructure, Gallant is working closely with their [Rackspace Support
Team](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) to determine what
steps are necessary to ensure uptime and avoid any interruptions.

### BENEFITS

For Gallant FX, Rackspace has been a great infrastructure partner. Their
website boasts, “We choose Rackspace, due to the quality and level of
service: on-site, 24x7x365 administrative support that monitors and
takes preventative measures, to remove any possibility of downtime. No
other hosting company provides this type of infrastructure.” Rackspace
support and monitoring are crucial to Gallant FX, which only has one
lead tech on staff.

Gallant FX has called on Rackspace to advise them on the type of
configurations needed to build out their application. In the midst of a
recent account review, Rackspace proactively caught an additional OS
upgrade that slipped under the radar. They quickly implemented necessary
changes to prevent any interruptions in their connectivity.
