### Email Takes Focus Away from Core Business

As a company grows, so does the cost of maintaining secure, scalable IT
infrastructure. This was the challenge facing Adam Chng, CIO of NetCom
Information Technology in 2004. “We had a Linux-based in-house email
system. But, it took too much time to manage, and due to having to
manage constant new email security threats, I ended spending too much
time dealing with email issues instead of our core business,” he says.

More importantly, Adam says, “It wasn’t our core business, so we decided
it was time to look for a business email provider.” In doing so, they
were able to spare themselves the long-term expense of hardware and
software upgrades while taking advantage of cloud-based technology to
handle the day-to-day management of servers, load balancers, spam
filtering, and backups.

“The decision to host and choosing the right provider impacted all of
our employees. It wasn’t a decision we made lightly,” he shares. Their
ideal partner for [business email
hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/) would not only
have the services, security, and functionality they needed, but also,
“We wanted a provider who was stable enough from an industry perspective
to be around for the long run,” Adam explains.

### Taking the Anxiety Out of Outsourcing

Investigating solutions online, he explored the Rackspace Email demo.
“The demo was very useful,” he says. Using the demo, potential customers
can click around the Rackspace Email interface to confirm it meets their
business needs. Rackspace Email features a business-grade webmail
interface with shared calendars and contacts, plus tasks, notes, and
free mobile sync. After speaking with our sales team, Adam was ready to
sign up. “I spoke to Trevor Winters and wound up deciding on Rackspace
because your company was more professional than the other companies I
looked at,” he says.

The level of accessibility and communication eases the anxiety
businesses may feel when moving from in-house management to a hosted
environment. Being able to pick up the phone or chat in at anytime for
help is a facet of [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/),
our commitment to creating exceptional support experiences for every
customer, on every encounter. “You promptly address issues. The level of
communication is great,” he says.

### Service Drives Continued Loyalty

The continued focus on product improvement and streamlining
functionality hasn’t gone unnoticed by Adam. “You’re always adding new
features and improving the system without increasing the cost,” he says.
Our Fanatical culture extends to keeping the [Control
Panel](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/control_panel/)an intuitive, easy
place for users of all tech knowledge levels, so the tech savvy and tech
novices alike can manage their accounts. “Over the years, the Control
Panel has remained current and very easy to manage,” says Adam.

“Hosting our email was a big decision, but you’ve offered us
consistently good service. That’s what has kept us here all these
years,” says Adam. When he needs service, he can tap the Fanatical
Support team via live chat, phone, or email and get the answers he needs
immediately. Another extension of Fanatical Support is keeping customers
informed. “When something is going on, you communicate with us every
step of the way. That’s huge. Some companies never tell you if something
is wrong. You find out later,” he says. With all of his support options,
he mainly uses the support ticket system. “It’s the easiest for me. I
always get a response within an hour,” according to Adam.

So impressed with his Rackspace service, Adam admits, “You do everything
correctly. So well, in fact, that our company wants to take some of your
customer support philosophies and implement them here.” Another Fanatic
recruited.
