**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:** Implement emerging authentication technologies

**CHALLENGES:** Attaining a scalable, easy-to-manage email platform

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace
Email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/)
with an intuitive [Control Panel
interface](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/control_panel/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Around-the-clock support and anywhere access at a
low price

### Better Email Means Finding a Reliable Provider

As part of a partnership with another company, Lockstep had access to an
internal IT team to maintain email service. “We had web access to email,
but the system wasn’t scalable. We didn’t want to be dependent on them,”
says Stephen Wilson, Managing Director of Lockstep.

They decided email hosting was the best option for them and began their
search for a reliable email provider.

### Easy Setup and Excellent Support

After reviewing email hosting options with several companies, Stephen
chose Rackspace. “We went with Rackspace because of the ease of use for
admins and support was excellent,” says Stephen. “It took just a minute
to set up. Support was excellent at taking over our mail
infrastructure,” he recalls.

“Lockstep is a very mobile company. Rackspace Email webmail is a must
have.” With Rackspace Email, they can access email from any web browser.
“Mobile functionality is key. I travel all the time, so anytime,
anywhere access is essential,” says Stephen. And, for a surprisingly low
price, Lockstep can provide all of their employees with enterprise-level
email service.

### Pricing and Support are a Perfect Match

“We’re based out of Sydney, so having real-time support at all hours of
the day is amazing,” Stephen states. He attributes his loyalty toward
Rackspace Email to [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) and
affordable pricing.

“Everything has been really easy. We haven’t had any problems, just
overall excellent support,” Stephen reports. He prefers using chat and
email for support. Summing up his overall experience with Rackspace, Stephen
Wilson says, “***Fanatical Support*** is fantastic.”
