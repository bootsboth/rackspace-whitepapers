**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** One of Holland’s largest full-service digital
agencies, hosting numerous ecommerce sites, including Body & Fit,
Benelux’s leading ecommerce retailer for sport nutrition and dietary
supplements.

**CHALLENGES:** Designing and implementing a reliable, scalable platform
that supports their rapidly growing base of ecommerce sites.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace Hybrid
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/), [Dedicated
Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/),
[Cloud Servers with Managed Service
Level](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/), [Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/?cm_mmc=PPCCA-_-Google-_-broad-_-online+storage+cloud),
[Cloud Load Balancers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/).

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** The agency is noticing improvement in customer
service related to the reliability of the site. Body & Fit has grown by
70 percent in the past year. They have also seen website speed
improvement since moving Rackspace.

### Rackspace helps ensure websites offer first-class online shopping experience

When Gracious Studios wanted to help customer Body & Fit, Benelux’s
market leader in sport nutrition, build a reliable, scalable and secure
ecommerce platform, they called Rackspace. To help improve performance,
the digital agency is experimenting with Facebook’s HIPHOP for PHP
(HHVM).

In the digital world, site performance is a key factor in customer
retention. As companies commit to online environments in a highly
competitive marketplace, a slow-loading site could send impatient
consumers elsewhere, meaning potential loss of revenue and damage to the
company’s brand.

Gracious Studios has been a Rackspace customer since mid-2013. Since
opening in 2007, this leading Dutch enterprise and SMB provider has
worked with the likes of bol.com, one of the largest ecommerce platforms
in the Netherlands, as well as German etailer neckermann.com.

Body & Fit serves approximately 3,000 people daily. To deliver the
consistent, highly responsive end-user experience that is essential for
a digital retailer, Body & Fit asked Gracious Studios to help design a
more reliable architecture.

### Fast & Secure: The Rackspace Hybrid Cloud Delivers

Working with Body & Fit’s stated priorities of maximum availability and
Gracious Studios’ goal of seamless integration into its environment;
Gracious Studios and Rackspace worked jointly to design and execute a
best-fit solution that would help ensure optimal Body & Fit online store
performance.

Gracious Studios rebuilt the Body & Fit site from the ground up in
Magento. Using a [Rackspace Hybrid
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/) architecture consisting
of two dedicated database servers connected to multiple cloud Web
servers, Gracious Studios has been able to provide the customer’s
ecommerce site with improved security, scalability and availability. The
hybrid infrastructure allows for growth in the Body & Fit database, with
Gracious Studios electing to spin up new servers as needed.

### Efficiency For All: A More Reliable Customer Experience

The highly collaborative hybrid architecture is paying dividends for
both Gracious Studios and its high-profile customer.

Body & Fit can enjoy a better performing site, leading to increases in
customer satisfaction, loyalty and strengthened brand reputation.
Powered by Rackspace, the Body & Fit site has improved flexibility,
security and performance. Since launching its ecommerce site with
Gracious Studios, Body & Fit is no longer experiencing significant
interruption of service or downtime.

By hosting with Rackspace, Gracious Studios decreases costs, raises
operational efficiency, and potentially increases its revenue among all
customers. In addition, Gracious Studios can monitor and test the
performance of different stages of all its internal development work.

“With Rackspace, our time to market is faster. We pay by the hour, and
only for the bandwidth we use, which has cut our costs roughly in half,”
says Suraj Sanchit, Creative Director, Gracious Studios. “So far,
Rackspace has answered all our questions. They’ve even taken over some
of the installation and configuration of the web servers, and haven’t
charged extra.”
