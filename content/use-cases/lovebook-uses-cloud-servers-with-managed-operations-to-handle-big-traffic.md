**The online retailer manages major traffic spikes using the
Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> portfolio of products.**

LoveBook Online, based in Royal Oak, Michigan, creates personalized gift
books that let its customers list all the reasons they love someone.
Customers choose the reasons from ready-made pages or edit their own
from scratch. LoveBook prints, binds, and ships the custom-designed
books anywhere in the world.

When LoveBook appeared on a nationally broadcast morning television show
last year, their site was hosted with a different hosting company. The
spike in traffic due to the appearance crashed their server, preventing
some potential customers from accessing the site. “There we were,
getting national attention, and our servers couldn’t handle the traffic
coming to the site,” says Chris Sonjeow, Co-founder of LoveBook. “We ran
out of connections, so we didn’t get as many people in there as we could
have. We immediately thought, ‘We need to find someone who’s going to
help us do this.’”

“That’s when we made a vow never to have our servers crash again,” CTO
and co-founder Kevin Zalewski says. “And Rackspace was there to help us
out.”

### Finding a flexible solution

LoveBook chose a then-new offering: [Rackspace Cloud Servers with
Managed Operations](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/managed_cloud/).
“They got us going, and were with us every step of the way, helping us
with everything we needed through the entire process,” says Sonjeow. “It
was excellent service.”

LoveBook’s products are popular gifts during the holidays, causing
seasonal fluctuations in their traffic. Because of this highly variable
traffic, they appreciate that Rackspace enables them to scale, clone,
and add servers at a moment’s notice. “We like to be able to scale up
during the holiday season and make sure that user experience isn’t
affected by the rush of people that come in,” says Zalewski. “We love
the ability to turn servers on and off when we need to, and make it
happen within minutes.” CIO and co-founder John Baranowski adds, “This
helps keep our costs down, allowing us to only pay for what we need at
that time. That’s an ideal business model for us."

In addition to Managed Operations, LoveBook uses [Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/),
[Cloud Load
Balancers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/loadbalancers/),
[Rackspace
Email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/),
and [Rackspace Hosted
SharePoint](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/file_sharing/hosted_sharepoint/).
“It’s been a great integration and a great help to our business model,”
says Zalewski.

LoveBook has since moved into a multi-tiered Cloud Server configuration,
using Cloud Servers for their web and database servers working in
concert with Cloud Load Balancers. Additionally, LoveBook has found
success using Cloud Files to store large amounts of user-generated
content, which can be easily served over the Akamai-powered CDN.
“User-generated content is a very challenging problem to solve,” says
Baranowski. “Rackspace Cloud Files allowed us to create an environment
where our user-generated content could be stored ‘on the fly’, allowing
each web head to share that content.”

### Ready for anything using Cloud Servers with Managed Operations

The next time LoveBook had a big national audience was the following
Valentine’s Day, when another nationally-broadcast morning show came
calling. This time, LoveBook was hosted on Rackspace. The site ran
without a hitch, serving thousands of concurrent customers with ease.

Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers allowed LoveBook to balance the traffic
to their databases from each web head in the system. This balanced the
load on the database servers and gave the company greater database
performance for their site. “Cloud Load Balancers provide LoveBook with
high availability of our data to help achieve zero downtime,” explains
Sonjeow.

“We believe that we have built a perfect blend of performance and
flexibility that should service us for quite a while,” he says.

### Backed by a "swarm" of support

Now that LoveBook has gone international, [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) and the
Rackspace high-performing environment provide LoveBook customers
consistent access to their site. “***Fanatical Support*** means that if we’re
having an office party on a Friday night, and something goes wrong and
we don’t know why, we just make a quick phone call, and within minutes
we’re back up and running without losing any customers,” says Zalewski.

“It’s a swarm of tech support,” Sonjeow jokes, “that attacks when we put
in a trouble ticket. The support is there immediately, even on a Friday
night.”

Baranowski agrees. “Your Managed Operations has been great for us,” he
says. “It’s exactly the blend of support we were looking for. When I
call our support team at Rackspace, I feel as if they are working with
me, not just for me. They take their support very personally. There is
no question in my mind that they love what they do.”

### Cost-effective scaling supports company growth

Would LoveBook recommend Rackspace to other growing companies?
“Absolutely,” says Zalewski. “As a startup, the service that we get is a
huge, huge benefit to us.” Baranowski adds, “The trick was to design up
front a system that handles our current traffic needs, and can be scaled
into something much more as our traffic grows. Rackspace Cloud
technology is the only way to go to be able to accomplish this cost-
effectively.”

“Before Cloud—what I think of as ‘BC’—we used to have to figure out
ahead of time what hardware we needed to run on and estimate future
growth,” says Sonjeow. “In the past we looked at our computer technology
as capital expenditure, but by utilizing your cloud environment, it just
becomes operational cost.”

Baranowski says that LoveBook has had such a good experience with
Rackspace that they now develop their products with the [Rackspace
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/) in mind. “From all that we
learned launching LoveBook Online, we now develop all our products with
cloud in mind, knowing the Rackspace Cloud facilitates our ability to
launch those products faster than ever.”
