**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:**
Austin-based fashion accessory brand with wholesale, retail and online
revenue streams.

**CHALLENGES:** Address heavy site load and traffic fluctuation as brand
experiences rapid growth.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:  **[Rackspace Private
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/), [Dedicated
Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/),
[Dedicated
Firewalls](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/security/firewalls/)
and [Load Balancers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Deliver speed, scale and flexibility to address
peak workloads and planned site growth.

### Rackspace provides the right platform and solutions to scale growth.

The rapid rise of Kendra Scott Design began with only \$500. In 2002,
Kendra Scott started her jewelry business in Austin, Texas with a modest
investment to create jewelry from a spare bedroom. In high-growth mode
since 2010, the company has been significantly expanding its wholesale,
retail and online businesses.

Since inception, Kendra Scott Design has risen to become a worldwide
multi-million dollar brand, with Scott’s designs sold through its 17
retail stores, via its ecommerce site
[kendrascott.com](http://www.kendrascott.com/), at more than 700
boutiques and at retailers such as Bloomingdale’s, Neiman Marcus and
Nordstrom.

In 2009, the company employed eight people. Today, it staffs 165, with
plans to hire another 150 as it opens additional stores across the U.S.
next year. The brand could not be hotter, with the jewelry featured
among some of Hollywood’s A-List stars, in movies, and on TV. A recently
added line of travel bags sold well, and Kendra Scott intends to
introduce new product lines.

“We are doubling our web business each year and we’re getting ready to
grow even more,” said Tria Foster, Vice President of Ecommerce & Loyalty
for Kendra Scott Design. “We’ve increased our sales since last year by
about 220 percent. For the web business, that’s phenomenal traffic
growth. We have a very engaged customer base on our website, so we take
the time to make sure we’re focusing on the performance and
scalability.”

**The Kendra Scott Solution - Powered by Rackspace**

To address Kendra Scott Design’s unique needs, Rackspace designed a
powerful, automated [Magento
solution](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/) for
deploying [Rackspace Private
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private) on bare metal. Using this
deployment system, Kendra Scott can leverage the capability to burst
into the cloud for peak periods, and only when necessary. Additionally,
Kendra Scott hosts its development, staging and production servers at
Rackspace.

“We really like the ability to expand into the cloud for peak periods,”
said Foster. “Together with our Rackspace and Magento technical teams,
we were able to design a solution that allowed us to move to the bare
metal with cloud burst solution, and we are working closely with them to
ensure we have a solid plan for growth over the next few years.”

Each Halloween, kendrascott.com offers a highly popular promotion during
which visitors browse numerous images to locate promo codes hidden
throughout the site. “When we first ran the promotion, our customers
were on the site an average of 28 pageviews, and we had problems with
the site. Fast-forward a year with Rackspace aboard, and we are
expecting everything to be just fine for this year’s promotion.”

“From development all the way through to production, we have very
similar environments. We have great day-by-day analytics and can
anticipate what our growth is going to be for critical peak times. We’re
doing performance testing well in advance, so that we can understand
precisely where we are, and where we need to be based on our
projections.

“We have a great social media team and our blog drives a ton of traffic
also, along with ad campaigns and marketing,” said Foster.

“As we continue to leverage what’s working and layer that on top of the
fact that now we’re opening new stores, the traffic is growing
unbelievably and we’re keeping our technical teams busy.”

### Consistent Performance Provides a “WOW” Customer Service Experience

Kendra Scott sees similarities between Rackspace [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ge7rotzBI0) ****
and its own proprietary customer service approach, referred to as “WOW”
Customer Service.

“Rackspace already knows who we are, they know exactly what systems
we’re using, they know exactly what platform they’re on. If there is an
issue, I know for a fact that I’m going to get it resolved, and
somebody’s going to stick with me until I do. If there’s an issue,
they’re on it, typically before my development team has to get involved.

“Considering our growth, ensuring that our infrastructure can support
that growth is extremely important. Having the ability to reach a solid
technical resource that is available 24x7 and truly cares about getting
to a solid solution allows us to control our uptime much tighter. In the
end, it’s about uptime and performance. We’ve been very happy with our
overall experience.”
