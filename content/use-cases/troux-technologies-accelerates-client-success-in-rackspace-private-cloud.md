**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Consistent, secure and scalable performance; the

**Rackspace offers platform architecture that delivers business results.**

### Company overview

Founded in Austin, Texas, in 2001, Troux Technologies performs
enterprise portfolio management and enterprise architecture for Global
2000 customers including leading global financial institutions,
multinationals in various industries and governmental clients.

“These are customers that have big IT spends, big complicated problems,
and they really need help understanding: are they spending their money
in the right places?” explains Craig Dalton, Senior VP of Customer
Success at Troux Technologies. “Troux was created to help make sure that
their IT spend and business goals are speaking the same language.”

Troux Enterprise Portfolio Management (EPM) solution, Troux On-Demand,
provides enterprise architecture and enterprise portfolio management
capabilities in a user-friendly platform. Customers using Troux tools
may also undertake agile portfolio management and enterprise
architecture, based on OpenStack and the Rackspace Private Cloud, and
powered globally throughout datacenters in the United States, London,
Hong Kong and Australia. In addition, Troux helps with configuration
management databases, project portfolio management systems and asset
management systems.

### Ensuring Trust and Enabling Growth

When large enterprise and governmental customers came to Troux concerned
about security, uptime, reliability and quality, the company found
Rackspace to be the best fit for its rapidly developing needs.

“We have customers who have saved millions based on the decisions that
they’ve made in Troux On-Demand,” said Dalton. “They want business
results quickly and we’ve found that Rackspace offers the specific
architectures that address those needs. Rackspace has enabled us the
agility that we needed to get systems on-boarded, to get our customers
in, and ultimately to create Troux On-Demand.”

The company first introduced Troux On-Demand on top of the public cloud.
As the product has grown, Troux has moved infrastructure to the private
cloud to take full advantage of OpenStack scalability, security, privacy
and control backed by Rackspace expertise.

“To improve performance and our security for our backend, we were faced
with options we didn’t have with our cloud solutions at the time,” said
Mark Castoe, Troux’s Chief Architect for Services. “In communication
with our team at Rackspace, we became aware of security, performance,
and cost benefits of moving to private cloud. We moved our U.S. cloud to
private cloud, and we’re now moving our UK operations to private cloud.”

Castoe goes on to say, “The architecture from Rackspace that we use is a
combination of the public cloud, the private cloud and dedicated
hosting. We have it all connected globally using RackConnect. So we’re
managing a global enterprise for our Troux on-demand customers and our
managed hosting customers from one central place here in Austin.”

### Strong SaaS Offerings = Reliable Customer Experience

Because of Rackspace, Troux has doubled the infrastructure committed to
Troux On-Demand, at a lower cost, and has added features such as single
sign-on authentication, as well as global distributed systems using the
security that the RackConnect provides.

“Troux On-Demand is built on top of the Rackspace Private Cloud, which
has enabled us to innovate and help our customers meet their business
needs, and gives them the confidence to put their enterprise portfolio
management data into our hands,” says Dalton.

As Troux’s global client base accelerates, the company can foresee more
work involving [Rackspace’s global
network](http://www.rackspace.com/about/datacenters/). Troux intends to
rely even more on cloud automation and scalability, can take advantage
of other Rackspace offerings such as offsite backups. And since
customers are dealing with ever-increasing amounts of data, the
Rackspace Private Cloud will enable Troux to continue to tailor services
scaled for specific customer trends.

”Because of the quality of the platform and the technically sound,
industry-leading technologies such as Rackspace Private Cloud based on
[OpenStack](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack/), we are able to
offer services like Troux-On-Demand to our customers” concludes Dalton.
“But the most important differentiator is leadership from the people at
Rackspace. Call it [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/about/whyrackspace/) or
just smart people who are really looking out for our interest.”
