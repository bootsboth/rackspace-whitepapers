### Company Overview

Globalscape is a global solutions provider that equips organizations to
securely exchange sensitive information and files with customers and
partners. Globalscape is a leader in Gartner’s managed file transfer
(MFT) Magic Quadrant and has been recognized with numerous industry and
analyst awards for their file transfer solutions. To meet customer
demand, Globalscape is now providing customers an alternative to
on-premises MFT implementations by providing cloud-based business data
exchange.

Globalscape Managed Information Xchange<sup>&trade;</sup> (MIX) won the 2011
Global Excellence Award from the Info Security Products Guide. MIX enables
organizations to securely exchange business-to-business data with full
24x7 management from Globalscape—all hosted on infrastructure from
Rackspace. Additionally, companies are eager to adopt the cloud, because
it provides a natural economy of scale. By using the MIX Managed MFT
Solution, they reduce the costs of maintaining and updating their
system.

Globalscape also offers Hosted Enhanced File TransferT<sup>&trade;</sup>
platform (Hosted EFT), another flexible, value add solution which allows SMB
customers and partners to securely exchange files and business data. Utilizing
Rackspace Cloud technology, Hosted EFT provides an attractive
combination of features and pricing for the SMB market.

### Globalscape - Experts at Software

Business integration and real-time data collaboration are essential for
companies of all sizes,” says Scott Baldwin, Managed Solutions Delivery
Manager for Globalscape. “Companies often attempt to implement disparate
software solutions which can introduce incapability issues. This can
cause security issues, downtime and loss of data.

RackConnect, Rackspace’s solution to connect Globalscape’s dedicated
servers with their Cloud environment, has been instrumental in
Globalscape’s technological success for its managed offerings. Having a
dedicated environment integrated with a Cloud footprint allows
Globalscape to enjoy the best of both worlds and to pass along these
benefits to their customers.

Baldwin adds, “Using Rackspace benefits our customers as their business
data exchange infrastructure no longer requires large, up- front capital
expenditures.” Globalscape is able to offer its customers a
scalable,outsourced solution, which allows customers to reallocate their
internal technical skill sets to other business-critical projects.

### Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup> Enables Globalscape to Provide Platinum Support to Their Customers

issues, Globalscape is able to offer a platinum level of support and
responsiveness to its own customers.

“We made the right choice with Rackspace, as we now have a trusted
partner who values our relationship and continues to deliver on their
commitment of ***Fanatical Support*** to Globalscape and our customers,” adds
Baldwin. “Rackspace understands our mission, our customer focused
culture, and the business impact of our solutions.”
