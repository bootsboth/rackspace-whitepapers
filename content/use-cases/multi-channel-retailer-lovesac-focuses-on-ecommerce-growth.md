**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** LoveSac is
a fast-growing multi-channel retailer that sells unique furniture
products.

**CHALLENGES:** In order to grow LoveSac’s online sales, the company
needed to evaluate and upgrade their current ecommerce strategy.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Dedicated
Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/)
and [Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/) for
scaling their [ecommerce
platform](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** LoveSac has grown annual ecommerce and retail
sales by 40 percent for the five consecutive years. They have also seen
website speed improvement of up to 20 percent since moving content to
the Rackspace cloud.

### Rackspace enables LoveSac’s online business platform in the cloud.

LoveSac founder, Shawn David Nelson started the modern day beanbag
revolution by making the first gigantic LoveSac fresh out of high school
in 1995. LoveSac is not just another furniture retailer, or brand of
bland designs. Each core LoveSac product is an original furniture
invention with the patents to prove it. LoveSac’s latest invention,
Sactionals, can be combined to build any furniture desired, including
chairs, sofas, chaises, and ottomans.

Darren Johnson, director of ecommerce at LoveSac, explains, “LoveSac is
a multi-channel retailer. We’ve been around for about ten years, with
more than 50 retail stores throughout the country. We’ve grown annual
sales by 40 percent for the last five years — on both the retail and
ecommerce side — very aggressively.”

### Magneto solution powered by Rackspace

As the LoveSac market has shifted to online, the company has
transitioned and been more focused on ecommerce.

The expectation at LoveSac is that the online portion of the business
will do as much in annual sales as their 50 stores combined within three
to five years. In order to accomplish this aggressive transition,
LoveSac combines leading [open-source ecommerce platform Magento with
Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/) — the #1
hosting provider to the top 1,000 retailers<sup>1</sup> — for a high-performance
online store.

“Previously, we were on an antiquated ecommerce platform,” says Johnson.
“We were with a second-tier hosting provider and found Magento and loved
it. As we upgraded to Magento Enterprise, our solutions partner
recommended Rackspace as somebody that we needed to look at as part of
our upgrade.”

“The thing I love most about Magento is the flexibility and ease of
managing products and content,” says Johnson. “It’s really the ecosystem
for anything in ecommerce that you want to do. You don’t need to build
everything in-house.”

### Growing with the Rackspace cloud

Growing annual ecommerce sales by 40 percent for the last five years has
required major scalability. “As we’ve grown with Magento, we’ve had to
scale our infrastructure at the same time,” says Johnson. “So every time
we’ve done that, our Magento partner has worked really closely with
Rackspace in architecting a solution that will scale with our
business.”

“One of the things that we’ve done that have helped a lot as we’ve grown
is moving over content to the [Rackspace
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/),” says Johnson. “We’ve seen
speed improvement of up to 10 to 20 percent since moving our content to
the cloud, which has been great for us. We do 40 percent of our annual
sales from Black Friday to Christmas. It’s really important for the
merchant, the solutions provider, and the hosting provider to have all
of your bases covered when preparing for traffic spikes.”

“We consider Rackspace part of the team,” concludes Johnson. “They
actually came up with a custom solution for us, to get more of our
content on the cloud, to speed up the site and to do additional
optimizations. Rackspace has been there along the way with really great
support.” Anytime that we have run into issues, the support’s been
phenomenal.
