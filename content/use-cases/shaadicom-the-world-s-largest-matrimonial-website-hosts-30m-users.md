### Company overview

Shaadi.com is the world’s largest matrimonial service, which has also
been recognized as the “Most Innovative Company in India of 2011” by
Fast Company, USA—one of the worlds leading progressive business media
brands. Due to continuous innovation and the development of a
user-friendly interface, Shaadi.com was ranked “39 Globally Amongst the
50 Most Innovative Companies” by Fast Company.

The matrimonial business is growing rapidly in India, as matrimony sites
are transforming the Indian marriage system and creating the ‘Internet
Marriage’ era. People Interactive, the consumer arm of the People Group,
owns the matrimonial portal Shaadi.com along with real estate site
Makaan.com and friendship and social networking service Fropper.com.

### Building a Premium Online Experience

In 1998, Shaadi.com saw an opportunity to build the world’s largest
online matrimonial site. At the time, online dating and networking was
non-existent; however, marriage and finding a good match remained a core
value. Shaadi.com set out to create an online experience that matched or
heightened the traditional dating and social networking experience in
India. But before it did, it needed to find the right IT partner to help
them meet this goal.

“As a startup and an online startup for that matter, it was important to
find a technology partner that allowed us to keep IT costs to a minimum,
while also providing the right IT infrastructure to meet our growing
needs,” explains Anand Mittal, COO & Director, Shaadi.com. “We needed to
find a partner that could help us build a premium online experience for
our customers—one that could accommodate millions of customers and scale
as demand grew.”

What was also important for Shaadi.com was to find a partner with a good
service level agreement (SLA), as availability and reliability of its
website was critical for building a successful business.

“Rackspace was an easy and clear choice for us, as Rackspace provided an
industry- leading SLA—one built on the importance of website
availability, uptime and support. Of all the potential partners who we
met with during our search for an IT partner, Rackspace value
proposition and focus on support was unprecedented—a partnership that we
couldn’t walk away from,” said Mittal. “On top of this, Rackspace
provided 24x7x365 ***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***, meaning on-call specialists
are available to help and advise at any time, day or night.”

### Managed Infrastructure Enables Rapid Growth

Beginning with one Rackspace server in 1998, the company has grown
exponentially since its initial deployment with Rackspace. Today, 30
million people use Shaadi.com, 3.2 million members have found their
matches through the site, and the company has built over 100 matchmaking
centres across 87 cities in India.

“Since day one, Rackspace dedicated hosting and Managed Cloud computing
services have been a critical component to the growth and success of our
business,” said Mittal. “Any downtime of our website is detrimental to
our business, as it impacts our brand image and damages customer
loyalty. To be successful and gain the trust of our customers, we
consistently need to deliver a seamless experience and make sure they
are happy. Rackspace enables us to do that.”

In addition to uptime guarantees, Rackspace dedicated infrastructure for
managing day-to-day traffic has enabled Shaadi.com to effectively manage
traffic spikes during growth spurts and peak traffic times. Today,
Shaadi.com effectively manages over 200 million page views per month and
over 10,000 registrations on Shaadi.com daily. It has been voted as the
site with the most visitors amongst matrimonial sites by Compete
Snapshot and among the Top Ten most visited websites in India by Alexa.

“As more people around the world get access to the Internet, the more
people we have coming to our site—and we don’t see this stopping any
time soon. With Rackspace, we’re able to rapidly scale as demand
increases, while also continuing to ensure the site is always available
and customers have access to the content quickly,” said Mittal.

### The Power of Support

While reliability and scalability initially attracted Shaadi.com to
Rackspace, ***Fanatical Support*** is what has made the company a satisfied
customer for almost two decades.

“Rackspace real-time and round-the-clock IT expertise and relentless
customer support has been critical to the success of our business,” said
Mittal. “With the team in place, we can focus on our core business as
opposed to dealing with server and network problems.”

“The recognition that we’ve received within the industry has been
humbling and rewarding,” concludes Mittal. “However, we couldn’t have
gotten these awards without the support of Rackspace. As we continue to
grow and expand around the globe, we look forward to extending our
partnership with Rackspace.”
