### Company overview

Karmaloop is the leading online retailer in streetwear, cutting edge
fashion, and a one-stop shop for the verge culture. The company was
founded by Greg Selkoe in 2000 and is headquartered in Boston. It
started, like many revolutions, in the underground, in his parent’s
basement. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to
disintegrate, Karmaloop pushed through the bust.

Karmaloop, Inc. owns and operates Karmaloop.com, KarmaloopTV.com, PLNDR.
com, BoylstonTradingCo.com, BrickHarbor.com, StreetAmmo.dk, Kazbah
Underground Brands, and owns 11 private label clothing brands. Now
selling over 500 men’s and women’s brands to a loyal customer base
spanning over 80 countries, Karmaloop’s online platform attracts more
than 4.5 million unique monthly visitors, with an estimated revenue of
$200M in 2012.

### A complete focus on unique

For Karmaloop, the biggest benefit of working with Rackspace is being
able to focus on the areas that the company does well and the things
that make them unique in the marketplace. Those areas include product,
service, attitude, and the social communication that Karmaloop has with
their customers. Running an infrastructure does not make Karmaloop
unique, so the company relies on Rackspace to handle that piece of the
product.

The [ecommerce platform](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/) at
Karmaloop is backed by [Rackspace Critical Application
Services](http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise_hosting/critical_applications/),
which is a sophisticated monitoring solution combined with a dedicated
team of Rackspace’s best engineers. This team provides ongoing guidance,
platform optimization, and troubleshooting for customers whose hosted
infrastructure is the lifeblood of their business. “At this point in our
evolution, we have the ability to deal with the top shelf providers in
any area. Rackspace made the most sense to us,” says Greg Selkoe,
Karmaloop CEO.

Hosting in the retail ecommerce vertical with Rackspace allows Karmaloop
to apply their resources where they can provide the most value-add to
their customers. This allows Karmaloop to focus on the best store they
can have, the best promotions for customers, and less time spent
worrying about the infrastructure that is running the website.

### Running a big ecommerce website

Karmaloop incorporates an in-house built ecommerce platform, using a
proprietary solution on the Microsoft stack, with a variety of .NET
tools with SQL servers on the backend. The primary needs that the
company must have running a large infrastructure like Karmaloop are
speed, performance and reliability. “We run a big website which must be
able to handle a very heavy load, fluctuations in demand, rapid page
loads, high scalability, and high application performance,” explains
Gary Rush, CTO of Karmaloop.

And, Karmaloop can’t afford for their site to go down, thus the need for
an [on-call support
team](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) that can help fix
any problems with their hosting immediately. “***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***
allows Karmaloop to be confidence that when issues arise, no matter what the
need, no matter what the time, the Rackspace support team is there until
the problem is resolved,” says Rush.

From a [PCI compliance](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/pci/)
standpoint, Karmaloop uses a tokenization vendor for storing credit card
information data, but counts on Rackspace for their [hosted
infrastructure security](http://www.rackspace.com/security/). “It
doesn’t get much more important when you’re an ecommerce company than
running the infrastructure that runs your site,” continues Rush. “That’s
your product. And so you have to have somebody that you trust in order
to do that. If that service goes down, our company is down, our revenue
stops. And because of that, we consider Rackspace a trusted partner.”

### Providing scaling, performance, and uptime

Karmaloop hosts all of the gear that runs their production website at
Rackspace, which includes backend servers, middle tier servers, and
front end web servers. With Rackspace, Karmaloop can deploy a variety of
state of the art servers whenever necessary, bring those servers to
scale quickly, which fundamentally allows the company to keep the user
performance great, page load time very fast, and provide Karmaloop
customers with an uptime of nearly 100%. “If it’s running the Karmaloop
production site, it’s running on Rackspace,” says Rush.

Rackspace enables Karmaloop to add resources as they need them, allowing
them to ‘buy’ the baseline capacity and ‘rent’ the capacity needed for
seasonal spikes. During the 2012 holiday season, Karmaloop’s sales were
up 60% from Black Friday to Cyber Monday and overall sales growth was up
40% year to date.

The Rackspace support team was ready for Karmaloop’s holiday site
traffic, having already completed [performance and load
testing](/how-to/peak-season-prep-guide-preparing-your-ecommerce-site-for-the-next-big-rush)
to help ensure that the infrastructure could handle the upcoming load.
“In our case, we tested up to a level that we felt was five times the
volume that we would see during that Black Friday to Cyber Monday peak
traffic period,” says Rush. “Once we were able to satisfy ourselves that
we were able to handle that load, we felt more confident.”

“The hosting company holds our heart in their hands,” concludes Selkoe.
“They can shut it down any time if they make any mistake. We need to
know that our heart surgeon is the best in the world and the person is
going to keep us running and healthy all the time. We feel very
confident with Rackspace Hosting in giving our heart – our entire online
store – in their hands.”
