### Company overview

TeamSourcing is a global company based in Ecuador that has become one of
the leading providers of mobile content and services in Latin America.
When CEO Armando Coronel founded TeamSourcing in 2002, its 5-person team
was focused principally on the Ecuadorian market. Since then,
TeamSourcing has grown to a team of nearly 60, and its reputation for
world-class products and services has helped it expand throughout the
region. TeamSourcing now does business in 10 Latin American countries,
working with mobile operators in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Guatemala,
Honduras, Panama, Mexico, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and
Colombia.

TeamSourcing has become a recognized leader in the Latin American market
and has formed strategic alliances with many of the top mobile content
creators, media distributors, and service providers in Europe and Latin
America, which allows the company to stay on top of the latest
technology and provide a large and ever-growing array of products and
services to its clients. As the company continues its expansion, it uses
Rackspace products to iterate quickly in response to market demands
while saving money and providing the stability and security its
customers have come to expect.

### TeamSourcing’s Developers Love the Cloud

TeamSourcing’s developers take full advantage of the cloud as a platform
for testing new ideas and changing configurations on the fly. “Our
passion is doing things quickly,” explains Giacomo Orizzonte, Head of
Production for TeamSourcing. “We don’t set limits. We are always going
to offer new things to the companies we work for even if we don’t have
them yet. Our passion is to sell these new things and then create them
extremely quickly. We have an excellent development team that is able to
work very quickly.”

### Rackspace Has Helped TeamSourcing Save Money as it Grows

Its reputation for results and innovation has helped TeamSourcing
generate projects outside of Ecuador and move into Latin America’s
largest markets. Rackspace has helped the company maintain a high level
of service as it expands. “We’ve grown along with Rackspace,” Orizzonte
explains, “increasing service along with our market needs.” TeamSourcing
began by using Rackspace dedicated servers and has been moving steadily
towards the cloud, first taking advantage of public cloud services like
Cloud Files. The company now runs a Rackspace Private Cloud powered by
OpenStack. Orizzonte explains that Rackspace’s services have been a
central part of the company’s plan for continued growth. “Right now we
have a mixed infrastructure using a range of Rackspace technologies,” he
explains, but “we are directing our growth right now towards the cloud
and we’d like to eventually have all the services in OpenStack.”

Why the shift? In large part for economic reasons: “I don’t know the
numbers,” Orizzonte concedes, “but I know Rackspace has been a huge
help. Especially with all the new challenges we’ve had since we
increased our services and products last year. We’ve started offering
mobile banking apps, and that’s forced us to have many more servers, so
OpenStack has reduced our costs hugely. We’ve gone from a traditional
infrastructure of having one physical server for each service to what we
have now, a few physical servers that provide a huge number of instances
through OpenStack, and that leads to incredible savings.”

### Stability, Security, and Support

In addition to the savings derived from optimizing its server
architecture, TeamSourcing values its relationship with Rackspace for
the stability and security it provides, which can be passed along to its
clients. “We came to Rackspace because we were looking for a host that
would give us a certain amount of security,” Orizzonte explains. This is
crucial for helping the company maintain its reputation and its strong
relationships with its clients. As Orizzonte points out, TeamSourcing’s
products and services help its clients – the cellular operators –
attract new customers and keep their current customers satisfied. “We
give the carriers high-quality, off-brand products that they can sell
as their own,” he explains. “We need to keep our relationships with the
carriers at 100%, and to keep service at 100%, so that they can give
their clients – the end users – stable and reliable service.”

Above all, Orizzonte praises Rackspace customer service, and especially
the [***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/about/whyrackspace/)
which he says has facilitated the company’s growth and been tremendously
valuable to his team. “We came to Rackspace because we were looking for
security,” he says “but the reason why we have stayed with Rackspace is
the excellent service they’ve given us, which has grown wonderfully.
We’ve never felt abandoned, and that’s why we’ve stayed with them. It’s
something that we truly love about Rackspace.”

### Support in Spanish

When asked about Rackspace initiatives to expand its presence in Latin
America, Orizzonte takes a positive view, pointing out that he doesn’t
know of any service provider in Latin America with Rackspace’s size and
capabilities, and certainly none that provides the Fanatical Support
that TeamSourcing values so highly. He points out that his own team has
already been the beneficiary of Rackspace’s increased presence on the
continent, noting the growth of the Latin American team (LATAM). “Now we
receive support from the LATAM team , who are really fantastic. They’ve
helped us grow. We have technical assistance and support in Spanish,
which is really wonderful for us.”

Would Orizzonte recommend Rackspace to other Latin American firms?
“Absolutely,” he says. “I would absolutely recommend Rackspace as a
technology service provider and as an infrastructure provider. The
experience we’ve had with them has been magnificent and we recommend
Rackspace to all of our industry peers.”
