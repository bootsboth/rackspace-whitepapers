**CUSTOMER BUSINESS:** Saint Francis
High School is a college preparatory, coed Catholic school in Mountain
View, California.

**CHALLENGES:** Saint Francis needed an effective way to distribute
educational content to 1,800 iPad devices, whether users were on or off
campus.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Cloud Files have allowed Saint Francis to
successfully deploy their one-to-one iPad program, enriching the
educational experience for students and teachers alike.

### Company overview

Saint Francis High School is a college preparatory, coed Catholic school
in Mountain View, California. In 2012, the school initiated a one-to-one
program that loans an iPad<sup>&reg;</sup> to each of its 1,700 students and
100 teachers for the school year. Students now use their iPad
devices for everything, from providing dynamic feedback in class to creating
presentations, annotating static documents, and making movies.

When mounting this ambitious program, Saint Francis’ Technology Services
Department grappled with the problem of how to distribute content to
1,800 iPad devices most effectively. The solution? Rackspace Cloud
Files.

### Serving the student body on campus and at home

One of the major dilemmas presented by the one-to-one program was that
students and teachers would be using their iPad devices both on campus
and at home. This meant that the technology services department had to
think strategically about content distribution.

Technology director Larry Steinke explains, “We knew that users would be
on campus sometimes and at home sometimes, so we couldn’t guarantee that
they would be using our high-speed network to download content locally.
Whether we had the files on-site and they got them from home or we put
the files off-site and had them download them on-site, it would mess up
our Internet bandwidth.”

Saint Francis needed a solution that would allow off-site users to
download files from an off-site host and onsite users to download files
locally. “We decided we needed to divide and conquer,” Steinke says. “We
did two things: we set up an on-site caching solution so that files
accessed from the Internet would be cached locally, and then we chose
Rackspace to host the files off-site.”

### Reuniting with Rackspace

Saint Francis had previously [hosted dedicated
servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/) at
Rackspace and had an excellent experience. “Rackspace had come
recommended very highly from somebody I respected,” Steinke says. “We
used their services for three years, and they were flawless, but we
didn’t continue further because it didn’t match our business needs at
that time. When this project started, we didn’t look at other solutions.
My positive experiences with Rackspace in the past led me right back to
them.”

Initially, Steinke set up a [Cloud
Server](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/),
but a colleague who’d looked into [Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/) saw
that it better suited the school’s needs. “He saw that it was an easier,
faster solution,” Steinke says. “It did exactly what we needed and fit
very nicely with what we were trying to accomplish. I decommissioned the
server I’d created, and we’ve been using Cloud Files ever since.”

How does the system work? Steinke explains, “If someone is on-site and
they download files that we’ve distributed through our iPad management
software, they’re getting them from our caching appliance—but really
they’re coming from Rackspace as a point of origin. If they’re at home
and choose to download content, they’re getting it from Rackspace as
well. Rackspace is our single point of distribution for providing
content, applications, and things of that nature to over 1800 iPad
devices. It’s really become a central part of our solution.”

Saint Francis uses Cloud Files in tandem with mobile-device-management
software JAMF. “Their solution allows us to decide which iPad devices
get certain icons or certain applications. If my colleague across the
room here decides that I’m supposed to get something on my desktop, I’ll
turn on my iPad and either it’s going to be there on the glass or it’ll
show up in an application called Self Service, which is our internal app
store. I hit “Install All” and it installs all of the apps that I don’t
currently have, and they’re available to me within moments.”

### Success and satisfaction

Cloud Files’ reliability and ease-of-use made for a smooth transition
into the program, especially in the beginning. Steinke says, “At the
beginning of the year, when 1,700 kids were each downloading 40
applications and other files at the same time—I was happy to use someone
else’s bandwidth and technology to do that. If we’d used a small on-site
server and distributed them over the Internet, I think the first week of
school would have been unproductive, with everybody stuck trying to
download things. Having some extra resources for that really helped
out.”

With an entire school relying on technology to get them the content they
need, when they need it, Steinke appreciates [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/).
“My experiences with Rackspace support have been 100% positive,” he says.
“This truly sets Rackspace apart. If my questions are really technical,
I am confident I can get routed to a suitable support person to get
answers. They always know more than I know... about everything!”

Thanks in part to Cloud Files, Steinke says, “Our iPad program has been
a great success. Our teachers and students are more creative than ever
and have been using the tools and apps provided to demonstrate
engagement across the board. Nearly every instructor is using the iPad
devices for dynamic activities and ways of sharing information in ways
we could only dream of a few years ago. Students are making movies and
collaborating on files such as lab reports and group projects more than
ever. The one-to-one program has really had a positive impact on our
school environment.”

What would Steinke say to schools interested in deploying similar
programs? Steinke says, “Many other schools in our area are looking at
similar programs, and eventually they come across the same questions
that we encountered last year, how to manage all of this data. We
recommend Rackspace, and we’ll continue to do so.”
