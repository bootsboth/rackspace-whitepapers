**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** Sprout Social is a social media management platform
that provides businesses with publishing, engagement and analytics.

**CHALLENGES:** As an early-stage startup, Sprout focused on product
development instead of servers; but as the company matured, their growth
was outpacing their ability to scale, resulting in the need for a
flexible hybrid infrastructure.

Hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/), [Dedicated
Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/),

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** From concept to current state, Sprout holistically
addresses social media engagement, publishing and analytics, resulting
in the company experiencing unprecedented growth, setting the gold
standard for social business.

### Company Overview

Founded in 2010 and based in Chicago’s vibrant West Loop neighborhood,
Sprout Social is a social media engagement platform that provides a
consolidated tool for businesses which includes publishing, monitoring,
customer service tools, analytics, and team collaboration features. The
company headquarters is a lively center of technology innovation,
product development, creative marketing and outstanding customer
service, with a team of more than 85 engineers, marketers, designers,
product specialists and customer service professionals.

Over the course of a few short years, Sprout’s team worked tirelessly to
set the gold standard for social business and now provides more than
10,000 customers with three key social media capabilities: engagement,
publishing and analytics. Sprout is used by leading global brands —
including AMD, McDonald’s, Nokia, Pepsi, and UPS — to increase the
efficiency of their social media presence and manage conversations
across Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn.

### Hybrid infrastructure = major differentiator

It wasn’t long ago that Rackspace was a scrappy startup, and since then,
the company has been committed to helping entrepreneurs drive the next
generation of businesses with hybrid hosting and [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/).
“Four years ago, Rackspace was a great fit for an early startup like Sprout,”
says Aaron Rankin, CTO and Co-Founder of Sprout Social. “As a business,
we needed to focus on product and not on servers. The [Cloud Sites
platform](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/) was the easiest and
most cost-effective solution to get us going and powered us for our
entire first year.”

As Sprout Social matured, so did their server needs. Today, their
platform is built on a [hybrid
infrastructure](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/). “We use a
hybrid infrastructure and to us it’s a major differentiator for
Rackspace,” continues Rankin. “Early on, our growth outpaced our ability
to scale so moving our primary databases onto large dedicated systems
was the quickest fix at the time and enabled us to focus on the business
instead of infrastructure.”

The Sprout Social platform manages more than six million social
interactions per day and makes it incredibly efficient for brands to
stay connected. Sprout’s seamlessly integrated publishing features make
it a snap to simultaneously post messages to multiple social networks.
Furthermore, Sprout’s centralized reporting and analytics help brands
make sense of their entire social strategy.

“We still host our high-write MySQL instances on dedicated hardware and
will until we can re-factor and isolate parts onto cloud instances with
SSD-backed Cloud Block Storage,” says Rankin. “Having the flexibility
that hybrid infrastructure offers — specifically the very short ping
times between segments — is something that only Rackspace has available
and was crucial to our growth.”

### Exceptional user experience

Sprout provides innovative features that businesses need to effectively
manage their social media and generate higher levels of satisfaction
among their audiences. As a result, customers use Sprout to not only
increase the efficiency of their social marketing efforts, but also grow
sales and provide remarkable customer support. Sprout is widely praised
for an exceptional user experience that becomes increasingly important
as social is adopted deeper into organizations.

Rankin breaks down how the company is a highly distributed system today.
“Web and mobile clients interact with an API that abstracts many backend
systems: storage, queuing, caching, eventing, etc. We process and store
lots of heterogeneous data that come in all different shapes and sizes
and that are created at widely varying frequencies. To make growth
predicable and to isolate issues, we’ve designed our system to keep
similar things together. This makes it easier and more cost-effective to
address complex processing, storage and throughput requirements.”

“The flexibility of a hybrid offering with rich cloud services lets us
bring our product to market faster and innovate more quickly,” concludes
Rankin. “The Rackspace infrastructure is an enabler, never a
constraint.”
