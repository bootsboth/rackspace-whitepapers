**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Access to premium infrastructure for interactive
video and application development

### Company Overview

A full service IT company, TStream Software focuses on interactive video
and also Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> software development and migration. In early
2007, they moved their entire infrastructure to Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup>.
Almost immediately, TStream joined the Rackspace Partner Network and began
expanding its business—generating more leads, leveraging Rackspace
programs, customers and partners, and gaining additional market exposure
through Rackspace.

### Step One: Become a Rackspace User

On one side of their operations, TStream creates interactive online
videos. The more engaging, non-static medium helps businesses better
communicate and sell their products and prompts viewers to take
immediate action. The videos take many forms—emercials, interactive
sales agents, personal web navigators, how-to videos and banner ads.

"I joined TStream in December of 2006 and my first act was to take our
in-house client hosted websites and internal operations, and move it to
Rackspace," says Dan Reynolds, vice president, TStream Software. "Prior
to TStream, I had owned my own company and had used Rackspace for myself
and all my clients, so I knew Rackspace was a premier player in the
hosting industry and it only made sense to use them again."

In his role at TStream, Reynolds is largely responsible for new client
acquisitions and customer service. A top-tier infrastructure and
seamless support are two of his main selling points.

"After working with more than two dozen other hosting providers in the
past, we eventually learned to really place a premium on support and
service," recalls Reynolds. "Rackspace delivers it through their famed
[***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)
and our clients couldn't be happier. If they ever have a hosting
question, all they have to do is call—our Rackspace team is always
available to us 24x7x365."

Once TStream and their clients were live at Rackspace, Reynolds' next
step and obvious step was to join Rackspace's Partner Network.

### Step Two: Become a Rackspace Partner

The second half of TStream's business, web technology and migration, is
what attracted them to become a Rackspace Partner. TStream is an
industry leader in Windows migrations and Microsoft software
development. Their custom software applications and migrations include
ASP.NET, Flash, Flex, Silverlight and SQL database development.

Rackspace, on the other hand, is known as a Microsoft hosting expert, being
named the Microsoft Hosting Partner of the Year in 2003, 2005,
2007, and 2012. A partnership between the two companies couldn't be more
ideal. New or potential Rackspace Windows customers can make use of
TStream's expertise for a seamless software migration while Rackspace
focuses on the hardware.

"Migration is a difficult yet necessary process," admits Reynolds. "No
two configurations and applications are the same, so every migration
must be custom. Through our unique design, development and testing
process, we work with Rackspace hardware engineers to ensure a seamless
transition into the Rackspace datacenter.

"The partnership just made sense from the beginning," continues
Reynolds. "Rackspace is the expert when it comes to hosting. We're an
expert in Microsoft technologies. Instead of trying to do each other's
business, it just makes sense to partner together and help each other. I
would never again want to host my clients on my own servers."

### Step Three: Reap the Benefits

Since becoming a Rackspace Partner, Reynolds has seen a breadth of
benefits emerge. For starters, it introduced them to Limelight Networks,
also a Rackspace Partner, who they now use to stream all their rich
media content.

"Just being associated with Rackspace has opened up so many
opportunities, like Limelight, which we may have missed out on in the
past," confides Reynolds. "Along those same lines, being hosted at
Rackspace really gives us a leg up on competitors because it makes us
seem much larger than a 30 person company. Hosting with Rackspace allows
us to be SAS 70 certified as well as benefiting from all the other
certifications like Microsoft Gold and Cisco."

Reynolds also says that the volume and quality of leads that come
through Rackspace is an immeasurable benefit. To him they are real,
qualified leads. For the most part, the customers that deal with
Rackspace, just 'get it,' he says. They understand the value of paying
for a premium infrastructure, so when TStream gets to talk to them about
technical service solutions, be it rich media or custom software
development, they're educated and easy to talk with.

One of the more active partners in the new Rackspace customer space,
TStream is now beginning to focus heavily on Microsoft Managed Exchange
migrations.

"Exchange is a great offering for our clients and an even better
business for Rackspace," says Reynolds. "Everyone needs email and it
saves our clients the hassle of having to look elsewhere. By having the
services of their business-class hosted email right at their fingertips,
Rackspace provides a complete IT hosting package. As their Partner, it
makes sense to become an expert in the Exchange migrations because a lot
of customers will need that application migrated along with their
infrastructure."

Now, anytime a TStream client approaches them for interactive video
production or application development, they are immediately hosted at
Rackspace. They are exposed to Fanatical Support and the confidence in
having a powerful infrastructure from the onset. In return, Rackspace
utilizes TStream when a new Microsoft customer needs to migrate software
to Rackspace or custom development projects, which also creates the
possibility for any additional development that customer may need.

It's a true win-win partnership—for the companies and their customers.
