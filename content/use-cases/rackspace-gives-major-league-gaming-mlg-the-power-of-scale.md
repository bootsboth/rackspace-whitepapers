### Company Overview

As one of the largest online professional videogaming leagues in the
world, MLG represents millions of the world’s best professional gamers
and offers aspiring gamers the chance to compete, practice, and
socialize via MLG’s massive network of sites.

The MLG website sponsors live gaming competitions for console and PC
gamers. The competitions involve maintaining connectivity for players
and streaming content for spectators, while at the same time creating a
seamless experience for visitors browsing the site.

Running a high traffic site for resource-heavy applications with
millions of user posts, game demos, recordings of past competitions,
along with other game-related media, MLG needed a hosting company that
could support the variable nature of their traffic and take over the
burdensome task of maintaining the infrastructure required to grow their
online presence, helping them focus on launching applications faster.

###  Why Rackspace?

“We host up to a dozen events a year. During an event, traffic can spike
up to 15 times normal levels. Building out dedicated hardware to handle
these peak loads doesn’t make sense,” says Brian Corrigan, CTO of MLG.

MLG also needed a solution to support dedicated network and
security-sensitive applications. Typically, that would mean either using
a cloud-based vendor to handle bursty traffic and a different provider
for dedicated servers, or worse, enduring the financial and
time-intensive investment of building and maintaining it all in-house.

“We considered a full virtual environment for our online properties, but
realized it was suicide to go all in. By the time we bought a VM that
could handle the I/O we needed, we’d have been better off with a
dedicated box,” Corrigan recalls.

Rackspace offers MLG another option – hybrid hosting. With hybrid
hosting, Rackspace customers can connect dedicated servers with Cloud
Servers. This functionality gives customers the flexibility of running
security or compliance-heavy applications on managed servers with the
option of tapping cloud infrastructure for traffic spikes or testing
environments. “No one should be launching a new large scale app on a
platform that doesn’t at least have hybrid capability. If you do, you’re
crazy,” says Corrigan.

For MLG, the Virtual Machine (VM) model lets them design apps
differently. Using physical hardware, an app has to use up all of the
available computing power to avoid wasted capacity. However, with VMs,
“You get the most bang for your buck because you can optimize the
machine around the app, rather than the other way,” according to
Corrigan.

MLG uses cloud environments to run their app servers, allowing them to
expand capacity up and down based on demand. They also have dedicated
hardware to handle databases and I/O-heavy operations. Both platforms
are connected with
[RackConnect<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/rackconnect/),
which links dedicated and cloud environments using an F5<sup>&reg;</sup>
BIG-IP<sup>&reg;</sup> Local Traffic Manager<sup>&trade;</sup>. When additional
compute power is added from the cloud, it’s immediately available for use, and
when the need subsides, they can scale down. The connected infrastructure
allows them to manage both platforms from one control panel. They also receive
a consolidated invoice for all of their services, and there’s only one
phone number to call if they have an issue with any part of their
configuration.

### The Benefits of Hybird Hosting at Rackspace

#### Increased Speed

Previously using only dedicated hardware, MLG lacked the flexibility to
deliver an optimal user experience. The optimal experience for their
users requires both platform availability and a fast time to market for
new applications. “Our legacy code was on old hardware that made scaling
it difficult. Now we use virtual machines to scale horizontally in the
Cloud and get our apps running as efficiently as possible with minimal
refactoring of old code,” Corrigan shares. Using Opscode’s Chef, they’re
able to automate post-provisioning tasks and content updates as well.

With physical hardware, they’d have to uninstall, clean, and rebuild for
each new use. In their new environment, the machine becomes a component
of the application and can be modified as needed. “With VMs, we can
delete a machine and start over. It’s faster and cleaner,” says
Corrigan.

#### Reduced Cost

 The biggest cost benefit for MLG is being able to temporarily provision
extra capacity to cover big events and launches. According to Corrigan,
a game launches and live events can temporarily increase traffic for a
short period of time. Between peaks, MLG would be left with loads of
unused capacity. Now, instead of putting their investments in hardware
they’d only be tapping for special events, they can invest in growing
their business. “If you go out and spend money on a SAN and big iron,
you better use it. Otherwise, you’re stuck with sunk costs,” he says.

Also, the cloud deployment model allows MLG’s developers to have direct
control of the machine. Many tasks previously performed by system
administrators can now be done directly through custom code written by
app developers, allowing more flexibility in staffing and reduced
support costs.

#### Fanatical Support<sup>reg;</sup>

 “We’re thrilled with the support we’ve received from your team,”
Corrigan states regarding his experience with [Fanatical
Support](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/). Our
award-winning brand – ***Fanatical Support*** – gives Corrigan peace of mind
that at any time of the day or night he can contact us by phone and
speak to a real person for resolution. “They answer the call in about 10
seconds, plus I know my Account Manager and techs on a first name
basis,” says Corrigan. Because we understand how important support is
when you trust your mission-critical applications and hardware to
Rackspace, we’ve built our reputation on providing an unmatched level of
service. “Rackspace goes way above and beyond. When they say ***Fanatical
Support***, they really do deliver a world class service experience,” says
Corrigan.

### Conclusion

For MLG, hybrid hosting is critical. Since implementation, they’ve
realized an 80% increase in performance over their previous architecture
while also seeing significant cost savings. Corrigan’s advice to others
seeking hosting services: “You’ll eventually end up with a scaling
problem that’s most cost effectively solved with hardware; so choose a
hosting vendor that gives you the most flexibility.” For MLG, that’s
Rackspace. Corrigan concludes, “Hybrid and the ability to scale on
demand becomes the new ‘table stakes’ in the online world. You’re at a
disadvantage if you don’t have it.”
