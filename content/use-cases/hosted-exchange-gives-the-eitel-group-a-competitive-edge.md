**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:**
The Eitel Group is a real estate agency specializing in residential
properties ranging from $200K to $2M.

**CHALLENGES:** The agency’s previous email provider was unreliable,
provided little support, and didn’t have enough storage for archiving
important documents.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace Hosted
Exchange](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** The agency now has the ability to check email on
the go, ample storage for archiving documents, and immediate support for
getting the most out of Exchange. Controlling their own email allows
them to build their brand independently of their broker.

### Company Overview

Based in Austin, Texas, the Eitel Group is a four-person team of real
estate agents managed by father and son Russ and Patrick Eitel. Over the
past seven years, the group has won numerous accolades, ranking in
Austin Business Journal’s top ten real estate groups and placing third
among Keller Williams’ 800 or so Austin agents. Last year, the group
made $20 million in sales.

Being a successful real estate agent requires staying on top of client
communications, often while out of the office. After a frustrating
experience with a previous email host, the Eitel Group searched for an
easy-to-use service that would allow them to field emails on the go,
reinforce their individual brand, and archive important documents
without worrying about storage limits. Rackspace Hosted Exchange solved
all of these problems.

### 24/7 Support

The Eitel Group sought a new email host when their previous provider
proved unreliable. According to managing partner Patrick Eitel, “The
servers would go down, and it was hard finding someone to talk to about
it.”

The group is currently partnered with Keller Williams, which offers its
agents company email accounts, but the Eitel Group opted for their own
mailboxes via Rackspace Hosted Exchange because of the Rackspace
reputation for stability and support. “They have Keller Williams email
addresses,” he says, “but the thing I like about using Rackspace is that
I’m not relying on their servers. If they were to go down, there would
be nothing I could do. I’d just have to wait for them to figure it out.
With Hosted Exchange, I have a contact at Rackspace that I can call.”

Switching email providers was painless thanks to [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/).
Eitel says, “Rackspace walked us through the whole migration. It ended up
going seamlessly.” In the rare event that a glitch occurs, the Eitel Group is
empowered in knowing they have 24x7x365 access to the Fanatical Support
team through a variety of channels: email, phone, and live chat.
Consumer-focused email hosts don’t guarantee a support response, let
alone a timely one, but Rackspace has more than 100 specialists for
Microsoft hosted products ready to help with issues that arise.

### Better Branding

Hosted Exchange allows the Eitel Group to maintain their individual
brand identity, regardless of what broker umbrellas them. “If I changed
over to another broker, I obviously wouldn’t be able to use my Keller
Williams address anymore,” Eitel says. “I like Hosted Exchange because
it gives me the ability to brand myself, and it’s transferable, no
matter what brokerage I use.” The Eitel Group’s motto is “Building
Relationships for Life,” and maintaining the same addresses regardless
of broker allows them to do so. In the event that the Eitel Group
switches brokers, there will be no need for mass emails alerting clients
to changing contact information.

As far as other options go, Patrick prefers the professionalism and
business focus of Exchange to consumer products like Gmail or Hotmail.
“I’m patrick@eitelgroup.com. Lots of Realtors have a Gmail address or
something like that, but my email makes me look more like a company.
It’s more professional.”

### Storage for Important Documents

Ample storage space was another must-have for the Eitel Group, who found
their previous provider incapable of handling the bulk of documents they
needed to archive. “A lot of my business is attachment-heavy, because
we’re working with a lot of large contracts,” Eitel says. “Often, when I
help someone buy a house, I’ll also sell it down the road. I have to
have those documents archived.”

After switching to Hosted Exchange, Eitel says, “The storage capacity is
huge. With Rackspace, each user gets 25GB of storage — more than twice
what we got from our previous host.” As an added bonus, the Eitel
Group’s team members can access shared documents from any computer.

### On-The-Go Availability

For real estate agents, one of Hosted Exchange’s biggest advantages is
its mobile syncing feature, which enables the Eitel Group’s agents to be
instantly alerted to new emails on their mobile devices. “I’m in a
business where I’m in my car, and I’m never really in the office,” Eitel
explains, “If you miss an email, you miss a lead. When a client is
looking at 20 different agents, the one who responds first gets the job.
With Hosted Exchange, I can respond immediately, which gives me a major
competitive advantage.” Hosted Exchange’s mobile sync is compatible with
iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Mobile. The agents can also use
Outlook Web App to check their accounts from any computer, any time.

### Satisfaction

Since their move to Rackspace, the Eitel Group has been thrilled with
Hosted Exchange. Having control over their email allows the Eitel group
to build their brand, and it’s simple enough for the least tech-savvy
among the group to use. If they have any questions, there’s a Racker to
answer them. So far, though, it’s been smooth sailing. “The good news,”
says Eitel, “is that, besides our initial migration, I haven’t had to
use ***Fanatical Support***. I haven’t had any issues, but I  know there are
people I can talk to if I do.” Would Eitel recommend Hosted Exchange to other
real estate agents? “Absolutely. We’re saving so much time and hassle, it’s a
no-brainer.”
