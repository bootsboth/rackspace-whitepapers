### Company overview

Many enterprises are turning to Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> SharePoint for their
content management and document collaboration needs, but Edelman Public
Relations, the leading independent global PR firm, is leveraging the
platform for more than just its out-of-the-box organizational benefits.
With the number of technological features and functions available to
assist with every aspect of the business, Edelman relies on SharePoint
for managing its global presence of 54 offices in 30 countries.

### Built from scratch

When David Rosenberg started at Edelman as an intern five years ago,
little did he know the SharePoint environment he was building would soon
be the grounds for a global deployment. From his beginnings as the
primary creator of Edelman’s SharePoint environment to his current role
as the Vice President of Internet Services, Rosenberg has had a hand in
every element of the tool.

When the need arose for a deployment in the Asia-Pacific region, where
Edelman did not have a datacenter presence, Rosenberg and his team made
the decision to look for a dedicated SharePoint solution that would
support their global presence, while also allowing them to maintain full
control of the SharePoint environment they had created. Rosenberg had
worked with Rackspace before, so he was confident in the breadth of
services and depth of technical support that is synonymous with the
Rackspace brand.

With a Rackspace Services for SharePoint solution, Rosenberg and his
team could migrate their customized SharePoint environment from in-house
servers to Rackspace hosted servers — and have a dedicated Rackspace
team that takes care of managing their SharePoint servers for them,
around-the-clock. This frees up Rosenberg and his team to be able to
focus on customizing and maximizing their SharePoint, without the
hassles of managing the SharePoint infrastructure itself, which consumed
a lot of their time before.

“We aren’t in break/fix mode anymore; Rackspace took care of that,” said
Rosenberg. “Forrest Burrows, our lead tech and the rest of our Rackspace
team are just as responsible for our SharePoint as we are.”

### Hosted solution increases team agility

Like many SharePoint teams, before working with Rackspace, Rosenberg and
his team were spending too much of their limited resources on
procurement and the mundane task of installing and racking servers. Now
they can focus their efforts on user experience and delivering business
needs on top of the platform that Rackspace maintains, creating an
opportunity to expand SharePoint beyond document management. Rosenberg
says that this relationship allows him to keep his team small and
nimble.

“All of the day-to-day living and breathing of machines used to take up
a majority of our time,” said Rosenberg. “Rackspace took on the
maintenance burdens, which unloads this large responsibility from our
shoulders. Now we can work more efficiently and our efforts align
directly with the strategic initiatives of the business.”

### Enabling global customization and unified strategies

Due to Edelman’s global presence, it was necessary for Rosenberg to
create a unified strategy that was easy to replicate across multiple
locations. As Edelman’s business became more public facing, it became
increasingly important to have language-specific SharePoint sites.

Using a staging site located in Chicago, Edelman created separate
translations for the numerous regional Japanese dialects. After being
staged, the content can be pushed into the Production Farm and delivered
to end-users in Asia, who can toggle between Edelman’s site in both
their native language and English.

In addition to creating the ability to customize global sites, Rosenberg
says that his account team at Rackspace mitigates many of the pain
points associated with large companies. Before Rackspace came into the
picture, procuring and on-boarding new acquisitions was a difficult
process, each different from the next. Edelman’s account team at
Rackspace has helped create a standardized IT process used during
acquisition and consolidation, providing for each segment of Edelman to
run in the same manner with the same practices.

### Service is the differentiator

Rosenberg knows his account team members at Rackspace by name and can
call at them whenever he needs them. He added that [Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) is
something that is “an enormous value-add” to outsourcing with Rackspace.

“One night I got a message at 1:30 a.m. informing me of an issue; by the
time I got to the office the next morning, it had already been solved.
If we had to take care of it in-house it would have taken two days to
fix, but with Rackspace it took 45 minutes,” said Rosenberg.

Rackspace is known in the industry for their skill and support as well
as a broad technical portfolio that includes dedicated hosting,
virtualization, email and cloud-based infrastructure. According to
Rosenberg, the depth of experience and knowledge that the Rackspace team
for SharePoint brings to the table is invaluable.

“It is all of the other ‘stuff’ that makes such a huge difference,” said
Rosenberg. “We can add a firewall, get around-the-clock service or spin
up a cloud. That is something that the other providers just can’t do.”

From the moment Rosenberg began the customer on-boarding process, he
says his experience has been nothing short of exceptional. He feels that
Forrest and the rest of his Rackspace team have become instrumental to
his internal team. It is that difference that Rosenberg says he relies
on, and ultimately why he continues to put his trust — and his
infrastructure — in Rackspace hands.
