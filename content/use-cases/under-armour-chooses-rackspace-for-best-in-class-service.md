### Company overview

As the leading developer, marketer, and distributor of branded
performance apparel, footwear, and accessories, [Under
Armour](http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/) has built its brand on
solid performance gear: products that make all athletes better.

The brand is known for its moisture-wicking fabrications, engineered in
many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate, to
provide a performance alternative to traditional products. Under
Armour’s products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels,
from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe.

### Big bets with big partners

The company’s commitment to excellence extends throughout their
business, including [www.underarmour.com](http://www.underarmour.com).
For Under Armour, the site is the online face of their business, and it
must be as solid and dependable as their products are.

In their early years, Under Armour relied on a local hosting provider
but, as the brand grew, they needed a bigger provider. “We have a saying
here, ‘Big Bets with Big Partners.’ We needed to find a major player in
the hosting industry,” explained Brian McManus, Senior Director of
Technology at Under Armour.

“We knew Rackspace was an early adopter of new technology, and they were
at the forefront of the cloud,” McManus added. “But we also wanted a
company that shared our values.”

“When we compared the attributes of
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) and Under Armour, there were
strong similarities between [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) and
our company’s four pillars of greatness: build a great product; tell a great
story; provide great service; build a great team.”

“Because of ***Fanatical Support***, we knew we were partnering with a
best-in-class company that shared our vision of getting it done,”
McManus added.

### Building a solid and scalable infrastructure

Rackspace worked with Under Armour to design a site infrastructure that
would support their e-commerce site’s high traffic, especially during
seasonal buying times. It was vital to find an infrastructure solution
that would provide high availability.

Since their growth follows a consistent stair-stepped pattern—where high
traffic levels are maintained even after large spikes—the team designed
a solution that runs on dedicated servers. This allows Under Armour to
deploy new servers in preparation for spikes, and then keep them up to
handle the continued traffic.

Another strategic component of the Under Armour website is brand
experience—showcasing athletes and stories that have been featured in
Under Armour ad campaigns and helping fans discover more about the
athletes through blogs and photos posted by the athletes themselves.
These sites are focused on the online experience, so uptime cannot be
compromised.

Since the brand experience sites are directly related to the company’s
ad campaigns, the sites experience high bursts of traffic during the
campaigns, and lower traffic after the campaigns end. Rackspace worked
with Under Armour to build a system based on [Rackspace Cloud
Servers<sup>&trade;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/),
which can scale up and down quickly. The design has proven to be ideal
for the brand experience sites’ cyclical traffic, with its peaks and
valleys throughout the year.

### People, process, and technology

By turning to Rackspace, Under Armour has achieved the high availability
they were looking for, but they’ve also realized a lower total cost of
ownership. “At Under Armour we look at things in terms of people,
processes, and technology,” McManus explained. “As for staffing,
Rackspace is an extension of our team. It’s like having additional
subject-matter experts to supplement our existing team.”

“As for processes, it’s nice to rely on experts in the field who can
help keep our information organized, which helps with PCI audits and
other processes.”

“And as for technology, we know that Rackspace has always been an
adopter of new cloud technologies, and they work with the industry’s
leading hardware vendors. They have a consistent strategic vision,” he
added.

Additionally, since Rackspace is handling their infrastructure, the
Under Armour technology team can focus on their core business. McManus
recalls, “In 2007, we were going into our holiday season, and our
database server demand was outpacing what our hardware could run.
Rackspace was able to resize it properly in 24 hours. If we’d been
hosting our own system in-house, that would have required getting a
purchase order, ordering, getting approval, waiting to get it back, and
doing the installation. That’s a good 14-20 day process. Rackspace was
able to cut that time and service that business.”

### Fanatical SupportT<sup>&reg;</sup> in action

“What I always say is that ***Fanatical Support*** is about transparency,”
says McManus. “I’ve dealt with everyone up to Lanham [Napier, former Rackspace
CEO]. At every level, people have made themselves accessible.”

“For example, it’s not uncommon for my account manager and lead tech at
Rackspace, and others on my team, to stay up all night with us during
maintenances,” he added. “And our lead tech takes our business so
personally, he’s probably more frustrated than we are if things go
wrong.”

For many years, Casey Casseb was Under Armour’s account manager at
Rackspace. McManus shared how, during that time, she had asked him to
participate in several customer panels. “She always said she’d buy me
dinner,” McManus joked. After a while, the number of dinners she owed
him was quite large. During one visit to the [Rackspace headquarters in
San Antonio](http://rackertalent.com/videos/the-castle/), Casseb
surprised McManus and the Under Armour team by inviting them to her home
and serving them a six-course Italian dinner she cooked herself.

“Our teams ate together and had a great time,” McManus added. “It’s
great to be treated as a person instead of a number. The personal touch
at Rackspace is what we appreciate.”
