### Company Overview

Inavero is a fast-growing company that helps business clients grow
through regular Net Promoter based satisfaction surveys of their
customers, employees and other important stakeholders. Inavero also
provides consultation services to help clients successfully apply the
results of their research.

Inavero’s online application consists of three main components: a survey
distribution system, a survey collection and data management application
and a results reporting dashboard.

### The Challenge

Inavero’s business has grown rapidly, and so has the usage of its
application. When a survey is sent, a huge peak in traffic follows
shortly thereafter as users log in to fill out their surveys. Inavero
needed its compute platform to scale with this demand, since the most
important time to ensure the system is available is also when it is most
vulnerable during these peak loads. Since Inavero is collecting data
from clients’ most important customers, server failure was not an
option.

“Scalability is key for our business,” explained Nathan Goff, Inavero
Operations Director & Partner. “There’s nothing worse than making our
clients look bad to their customers.”

### The Solution

Hosting with a local ISP wasn’t working. The ISP’s 24x7 support was hard
to access, the virtual environment costs were high, and system restarts
were performed without notifying Inavero (which caused service
interruptions). Three times their servers were taken down without
notice. As a result, Inavero turned to Rackspace to host their entire
critical compute infrastructure: development and test systems, marketing
websites, and the core survey applications. They chose Rackspace because
of scalability, price (less than other cloud providers and their ISP),
24x7x365 support with instant access via chat, and Rackspace’s culture
of strong client service, which closely aligned with their own.
Additionally, Rackspace Cloud Server technology “really wowed us,” Goff
added. “I could go on and on.” He also appreciated Rackspace’s
participation in NPS—which reflects Rackspace’s commitment to actively
listening and responding to their customers.

“At Inavero, we specialize in measuring a firm's attention to client
service—so I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. Rackspace is
definitely a good egg,” shared Goff.

Inavero has chosen a hybrid solution of Cloud Servers, Managed Servers
and Cloud Sites:

-   Cloud Servers: Inavero uses Cloud Servers to host their survey platform for
surveys with a defined distribution. Cloud Servers can be added quickly when a
new survey launches and sized to the needs of each survey. Cloud Servers also
houses their internal survey management UI and external survey dashboard UI, as
well as their development environment.

-   Managed Servers: They use Managed Servers to house their main database and
Sendmail server. “This is where the heavy disk I/O stuff is done,” Goff
explained.

-   Cloud Sites: They use many Cloud Sites for different purposes, including
marketing sites, bug tracker and internal CRM (SugarCRM). In addition, for
surveys where load or response rate is hard to predict, Inavero leverages the
automatic scaling of Cloud Sites to adapt to the variable nature of their
marketing site traffic.

 Long term, Inavero hopes to move more and more of their variable load
applications to the Rackspace Cloud.

### What's in the Future?

As Inavero grows, scalability will become even more important. Growth
means more occasions when multiple survey campaigns are happening
simultaneously, making those traffic spikes much more difficult to
predict. Having the ability to quickly scale compute resources as
traffic spikes will be the key to helping Inavero collect each response
to every survey. Rackspace’s broad portfolio has allowed Inavero to
match the right compute platform with the unique needs of each
application. And as they grow, so will their compute needs.

[RackConnect](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/rackconnect/),
which connects Dedicated and Cloud Servers at Rackspace, will provide
additional ways for Inavero to leverage the Rackspace portfolio in a
seamless way, as a solution, offering the scalability and flexibility
that their growing business will continue to demand.
