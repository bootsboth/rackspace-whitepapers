**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:** Produces technically advanced, all natural
products to prevent blisters, chaffing, and cracked skin for sports,
work, or daily use.

**CHALLENGES:** Email hosted with web host lacks control and flexibility

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Hosted Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>
Exchange](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/ "Hosted Exchange")
with support for PCs, Macs, and push technology for [mobile
devices](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/on_your_mobile/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Rackspace now hosts their email and website

### Web Host Couldn’t Support Email Needs

Bodyglide, official sponsors of the USA Triathlon team, solves skin
issues like skin irritation, sun exposure, and the resulting pain for
athletes. Nestled in Bellevue, WA, they were having problems solving
their email issues.

Their email, handled by a web hosting service, “hadn’t kept up with the
growing complexities of email. We’re a tightly organized company using
enterprise-level software, BlackBerrys^®^, iPhones™, Mac’s, and PC’s
outsourcing email and website hosting,” according to Bill Sternoff,
President of Bodyglide, “and our vendors couldn’t give us the support we
needed.”

With issues related to connectivity between wireless and desktop devices
and a lack of dedicated resources to fight spam and viruses, Bodyglide
was looking for a better alternative to address all of their business
email problems.

### Rackspace Offers Control and Total Integration

Acting on a referral, they tried out another email hosting company and
quickly found that company couldn’t support all of their devices as
promised or provide them with the level of control needed to effectively
manage email, like whitelists, blacklists, and message filtering. He was
especially disappointed in their inability to integrate their Macs. As a
result, within 24 hours, Bill was on the hunt again. And then he found
Rackspace.

With Rackspace, he found an email service that not only solved his email
problems but also offered a level of support he hadn’t found elsewhere.
“It was a flawless transition. They got us set up and did the physical
transition. I marveled every time I picked up the phone. Someone
answered the phone, in my language, in my country, and had an answer,”
gushes Bill. During the sales process, he was delighted at how we “held
his hand all the way through” and called back multiple times to ensure
everything was going well. This, he says, “is very unusual in the
business world today.”

Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Exchange offered the best fit for seamless integration
with Bodyglide’s multi-device environment. BlackBerry licenses and
ActiveSync<sup>&reg;</sup> for iPhone solve wireless connectivity issues. Our
triple layer spam and virus scanning is a perfect fit for reducing the amount
of threats entering their network. Plus, the administrative Control
Panel gives him complete control over message filtering.

### Email Success Spurs Decision to Move Website to Rackspace

Now, Bodyglide can keep the communication loop going between wireless
devices and desktops in their new Exchange environment. They’ve also
experienced a dramatic reduction in spam and filtering issues since
moving their email to Rackspace. Bill is happy with the ease of setting
and adjusting spam controls and message filtering in our easy-to-use
[administrative Control Panel](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/control_panel/).

“You can tell when you call a company different days and different times
of the day if there are inconsistencies in service. I feel confident
when I call; it’ll be picked up in 10 seconds,” says Bill. He also
expresses his appreciation of our upfront pricing model, “Competitors
offered rate cards to get you in the door and then drove the cost up
with hidden fees. You’re site was upfront, this is what we charge, this
is what you get.”

Bill was so impressed with our service; he fired his current web hosting
provider and moved his website over to the [Rackspace
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/ "Cloud Hosting "). Comparing his
previous email system to Rackspace, he adds, “I didn’t know it could be
this easy.”
