### JC Global offers IT management and software solutions to Latin American businesses.

Based in Mexico City, JC Global Resources de Mexico is an IT management
company serving medium to enterprise-level businesses in Mexico, Puerto
Rico and Venezuela. The company offers a broad portfolio of services to
its customers, including testing and automation, an open source SaaS
offering for medium businesses in need of an affordable ERP, and a
forthcoming product that delivers Rackspace Private Cloud with HP
management tools for enterprise-level customers.

Because many of JC Global’s customers are subject to regulations that
disallow the storage of data across international borders, an on-premise
cloud was a natural choice. Rackspace Private Cloud has allowed JC
Global to harness the power of OpenStack without spending the money or
time recruiting the team of private cloud experts such a project would
require. They see Rackspace support as the differentiator that will
bring wider OpenStack adoption among Latin American enterprises.

### Simple to deploy

When JC Global decided to build a private cloud in their data center,
they looked into several OpenStack distributions. “We tried Ubuntu MAAS
and StackOps, but Rackspace Alamo was the best and simplest solution for
us,” says JC Global owner Juan Manuel Caceres.

“Rackspace Private Cloud has a feature that nobody has right now — it’s
easy,” Caceres says. “MAAS from Ubuntu was too complex for us. For
starters, they need eight servers. If I grow a lot, maybe I’ll need
that, but I prefer to start small. As I grow, I may migrate, but not
right now.” Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack means that JC
Global is free from vendor lock-in and able to reevaluate their systems
as their business evolves.

However, Rackspace’s responsiveness may keep JC Global loyal. “Before I
came to Rackspace, when I spoke with MAAS, I requested a quote for
support,” Caceres recalls. “It was more than six days, and no one gave
me an answer. When I did the same thing with Rackspace, I had my quote
the next day.”

### Instant head count

Rackspace Private Cloud has allowed JC Global to reallocate budget that
would have otherwise been spent on OpenStack configuration specialists.
“Rackspace solves a problem for us,” says Caceres. “I don’t need to hire
an OpenStack expert team, which I’d planned to do in the beginning. I’d
planned to have 10 or 15 people with deep knowledge of how to configure
OpenStack, but after I started to work with Rackspace, I said, ‘I don’t
need to hire those people.’” Asked whether finding those people would
have been easy, Caceres laughs. “No, definitely not!” he says. “It would
have taken six, seven months.”

On install, Alamo gives you an OpenStack cloud configured according to
the recommendations of Rackspace specialists for OpenStack. These
recommendations are based on the deep expertise in OpenStack Rackspace
has developed as a cofounder of the platform. That means that Caceres
can focus on how to best use OpenStack rather than worrying about
architecture. Caceres says, “I’m hiring more people for development with
Swift,” OpenStack’s scalable object storage. “Instead of configuration
people, I now have developers and people who know how to interact with
OpenStack. For our configuration problems, we look to Rackspace.”

### Suitable for SMB and enterprise customers

JC Global initially used Rackspace Private Cloud to provide its
customers with testing and development environments. Seven months ago,
they added Spirit Market to their portfolio, an offering where medium
businesses access and get support for a variety of open source
applications. Caceres explains, “In our Private Cloud, we have images of
OpenERP, OrangeHRM, Sugar CRM, Jaspersoft Community Edition and Elgg for
social networking. When a medium business needs an ERP, but doesn’t have
enough money for SAP, they can use Spirit Market for a monthly charge,
including support. Private Cloud allows me to bring these applications
to customers whose data can’t leave the country.”

Next, they’re launching Spirit Cloud, a service for enterprises that
offers HP management tools with Rackspace Private Cloud. For Caceres,
the ability to offer Rackspace support on top of OpenStack has been a
major differentiator that’s piqued his enterprise customers’ interest.
Caceres says, “We created a product in HTML5 and embedded the Rackspace
portal features into HP BSM—a business service monitoring application
that gives you a 360 view of all of your applications and your business
services. For managed OpenStack, customers won’t have to move out of HP
BSM, they’ll just have an additional tab in which we embedded the
Rackspace Private Cloud management portal. You can provide images, you
can provide instances, you can work with volume assignation and things
like that. When the customers see that they can combine the HP
management capabilities they’re already using with Private Cloud support
from Rackspace, they’re very enthusiastic.”

Caceres is also enthusiastic. “Rackspace services are working very well
for us right now,” he says. “The support response time is very good, and
we’re feeling great right now. We’re going to grow, and we’re planning
to do so with Rackspace.”
