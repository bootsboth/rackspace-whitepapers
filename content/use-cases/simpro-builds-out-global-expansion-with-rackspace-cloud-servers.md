### Company overview

Australia’s simPRO Software has built a thriving firm helping
tradespeople use the cloud to run their businesses. simPRO is the global
leader in job management software for the services and contracting
sector. Established in 2002, the company’s clients range from small
contractors to huge trade service firms with thousands of employees. To
support and enhance its web-based software, simPRO has operations in
Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.

simPRO clients appreciate how the cloud- based software helps them
streamline their operations and generate better results. One major
advantage is real-time mobility. Field service people can use an iPhone
or Android device to check work orders, update estimates, and complete
forms from anywhere. This saves hours of travel and rekeying scribbled
notes, and speeds invoicing and collections. Overall, the system
dramatically boosts what the company calls the “three Pro’s” of simPRO:
processes, productivity, and profits.

### No more hardware headaches

At first, simPRO ran its own servers, dealing with all the headaches of
sourcing, buying, and tweaking hardware. “We used to manage all of our
infrastructure ourselves and we found there was a heavy overhead and
cost,” said Jonathan Eastgate, simPRO’s CTO. Every time the company
added a few new clients, they had to buy more hardware and set it up.

To eliminate these chores, simPRO tried outsourcing servers to local
providers. But they couldn’t get what they needed: bulletproof support,
a range of services, and a global presence that could handle the
company’s expansion. The company began looking for the right partner
with a full range of services and top-flight support to keep simPRO’s
customers productive, both on the road and back at the office.

Eventually, simPRO found what they were looking for in Rackspace. The
company offered a mantra of [Fanatical
Support<sup>&trade;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/about), a wide range of
services from bare metal to hybrid cloud, and worldwide reach. SimPRO moved all
its workloads to Rackspace in 2010. At first, the company used both
[dedicated and cloud servers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid),
with a main data center in Chicago and sites in Dallas and Hong Kong.

Today, simPRO is migrating to [high-performance cloud servers with SSD
storage](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers), and adding access
points in the UK and across the U.S. to generate faster speed for users
anywhere in the world. For example, I/O wait has been slashed 40% on
database instances deployed with SSD [Cloud Block
Storage](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/block-storage)—a flexible,
on-demand storage option from Rackspace. In addition, simPRO has reduced
its costs; due to the lower cost per instance, the firm now deploys
almost one-third more web-server capacity.

“The move to Rackspace has meant not having to worry about
infrastructure or hardware costs, so we can focus on deploying our
software on Rackspace’s great infrastructure,” said Eastgate. “And the
Rackspace team gives us really handy advice on how to grow our systems
to suit our global expansion.”

### Finding a great partner in Rackspace

“Since our move to the Rackspace cloud, we’ve seen a massive increase in
responsiveness in all our applications,” said Eastgate. **In fact,
application response has improved 20% overall, compared to the earlier
physical infrastructure.** “Clients get fast access to our systems, no
matter where they are in the world. That ease of growing globally makes
Rackspace a great avenue for any company that wants to take its product
worldwide.”

Today, simPRO is preparing for its next major product update by
migrating to high-performance cloud servers with SSD storage, and is
adding access points in Australia, the UK, and across the United States
to generate faster speed for users anywhere in the world.

The fabled Fanatical Support from Rackspace enables simPRO’s team to get
on with the job of building out its client base, without worrying about
infrastructure. “Rackspace’s Fanatical Support means we’ve got
infrastructure and support people available by phone 24/7. Our account
manager in Sydney can escalate our call to any operational person in any
data center around the world, to give us the fastest possible
resolution,” said Eastgate. “No other provider could offer this.”

Would simPRO executives recommend Rackspace? “I have recommended
Rackspace to many other CTO’s because of the level of service and the
great relationship we have with the team in Sydney,” Eastgate said. “We
see Rackspace as a partner in what we do, not a provider. And that makes
a big difference.”

The company CEO agrees. “As the business is growing geographically and
our product is growing in breadth and depth, we need to have confidence
that our partners can scale with us and deliver what we’re looking for
in capacity and support,” said simPRO CEO Brad Couper. “We have great
confidence in Rackspace. They really deliver the value that we’re
looking for in a technology partner.”
