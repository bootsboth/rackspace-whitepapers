### Customer Overview

MindSnacks, founded in May 2010, is a platform of language-learning
games designed for touchscreen devices. Traditionally, much of language
instruction has used old-school methods like flashcards and rote
memorization. “We wanted to be the opposite of that,” said Jesse
Pickard, co-founder and CEO at MindSnacks.

In early 2011, MindSnacks launched iPhone apps for learning Spanish,
French and Italian. In the future, MindSnacks plans to offer additional
languages and subjects, including SAT prep. The company reports that in
March 2011, their French-language app was the top educational app in the
App Store.

In February 2011, the San Francisco-based company raised $1.2 million
in funding.<sup>1</sup> They currently have eight employees, and anticipate
bringing on several more within the next six months.

### Solving the Mobile App Problem

“Right now our needs are small, but they’re growing,” says Jesse
Pickard, co-founder and CEO of MindSnacks. “Our primary needs are for
data storage, text, and audio.” Because their app includes both text and
audio of the vocabulary words, the app’s initial download footprint was
50-60 megabytes.

In the iPhone<sup>&reg;</sup> App Store, there’s a 20MB limit on what’s allowed
to be downloaded over the 3G network. Any apps bigger than 20MB have to be
downloaded later, over a wireless network—which means that potential
customers could be lost.

To overcome this challenge, the team at MindSnacks focused on making
their app as small as possible. “We offload a lot of the vocabulary onto
a Rackspace server, so that it’s accessed only as needed,” says Pickard.
“A lot of other games just blow past that 20MB limit, but by staying
under it, we get a lot more traction.”

So far, MindSnacks needs just one Cloud Server — and they use it to
store the app’s vocabulary bank, as well as for development and for
storing certain data for analytics using a python web application.

### Running Test/Dev in the Cloud

Many customers choose to run testing and development in the cloud
because of the flexibility it allows, the simplicity of utility pricing,
and the cost savings they often find. For MindSnacks, those benefits are
great, but the convenience is the best of all.

“We started off using VMware to make a local copy of the server,” says
Karl Stenerud, co-founder of MindSnacks, “and that works okay, but the
convenience of just spinning up a new server in the cloud without all
the setup hassles makes cloud-based development a more attractive option
overall.”

For Stenerud, the time saved by spinning up Cloud Servers for test/dev
makes the cloud an easy choice. “Our primary concern in this regard is
minimizing the time spent on things that are not our core business, and
server maintenance is most definitely not our core business,” he says.

### Finding the Right Hosting Solution

“For us, the biggest issue is we’re just getting into the cloud,” says
Stenerud. “So we were looking for a service that was very accessible and
very easy to get into at the startup level. We needed something that
would give us the ability to grow when we needed to grow quickly.”

“During the summer of 2010, we started looking at hosting solutions,”
continues Stenerud. “We explored both Rackspace and Amazon. We hit on
Rackspace because a fellow entrepreneur was using Rackspace, and he
recommended it.”

MindSnacks signed up for the Rackspace Cloud, and have been very
satisfied with the products and services they’ve used so far. “We have
full control, full root access,” explains Stenerud. “It’s as if we had
our server sitting down in our basement.”

They’ve been pleased with the Rackspace Cloud’s features, too. “The
replication is very cool,” says Stenerud. “We’ve been able to spin up
really quickly.”

As a startup, MindSnacks never really considered dedicated servers. “It
would be technically possible, but I wouldn’t recommend it for
startups,” says Stenerud. “I would definitely go with the opportunity to
use the cloud—for us, the cloud is cheaper.”

### 500 Startups and the Rackspace Startup Program

MindSnacks has been an active participant in the community of tech
incubators. They were in the 2010 class at Philadelphia incubator
Dreamit Ventures, after which they moved to Silicon Valley to open an
office in downtown San Francisco.

Once they landed on the west coast, they fell in with 500 Startups
almost immediately. “We met Dave [McClure] right off the plane, pretty
much,” explains Pickard. “One of his portfolio companies thought we’d be
a good fit.” The rest is history: “We went to a café in San Francisco,
and he fell in love with the product.” Their relationship with Rackspace
grew as they became a part of 500 Startups. “It’s important to stay
scrappy,” says Pickard. “One of the things that drew us toward Rackspace
is being with a company that cares.”

The *MindSnacks* apps are currently available for iOS devices, with apps
for Android coming soon.

As their company grows, so will their Rackspace footprint. “I definitely
anticipate more horsepower needs as our user base and markets grow.
We’re in a major data-crunching phase, looking at the trends and
behaviors at work, and the cloud is a good place to store and analyze
all that data.”

### The Greatest Asset is Customer Support

Flexibility and value attracted MindSnacks to the Rackspace Cloud, but
they claim [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) is
what makes them satisfied customers. “The greatest asset is customer support,”
says Stenerud. “Any time we’ve had any issues, Rackspace has been very
responsive for us.”

Stenerud explains that hosting was not always this simple. “I’ve been in
the tech industry about 13 years, and it was always the case where you
had the dungeon in the basement, with this big iron, and a huge team
that needed to maintain this thing.”

“Dealing with servers is not really part of your core business,” says
Stenerud. “You don’t want to deal with it, but you have to. So just
being able to have somebody else deal with all the backups, all the
scalability, all the uptime issues—and all you have to do is just deploy
your product? That’s just amazing. It’s beautiful.”
