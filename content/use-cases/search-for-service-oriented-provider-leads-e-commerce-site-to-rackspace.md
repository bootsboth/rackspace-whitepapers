### Company overview

National Trade Supply was launched by two friends in 2003 as a website
dedicated to selling furnace filters. Though the company has grown
dramatically—now operating 16 separate websites and booking $28 million
in sales last year—NTS remains a lean organization. It has just 20
employees, and only one of them is devoted to IT.

As an e-commerce company, NTS ([ntsupply.com](http://www.ntsupply.com/))
is entirely dependent on the functionality of its websites. And to
ensure they remain up and running virtually non-stop, the company relies
on [Rackspace Hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/).

“There are only two or three companies we do business with that I can
endorse without hesitation, and Rackspace is at the top of the list,”
says Tyler Dishman, NTS Co-founder and current Vice President of
Technology.

### Focus on service makes Rackspace stand out

National Trade Supply, once ranked the fourth fastest-growing e-commerce
business in the U.S., has depended on third-party hosting from the very
start. Dishman developed the site’s content and had it hosted by a
small, local company in Indianapolis. Looking back, he says that initial
hosting experience was ill-advised. But he really didn’t know any
better.

“Once, on the day after Thanksgiving, our whole site shut down. The
server had crashed. It should have been a big sales day for us, and we
had no way of doing business. Zero transactions. And when I talked with
the support people, I wasn’t sure they knew much more than I did about
how to fix the problem.”

When Dishman began searching for a new hosting company, his first
priority was finding a partner that was service-oriented. He surveyed
larger companies that he knew from e-commerce trade shows and heard
glowing recommendations for Rackspace.

“Rackspace was exactly what I was looking for. Their focus on
service—what they call ‘***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***’—really
attracted me to them. And they’ve delivered on that promise time and again.”

NTS started with an entry-level server from Rackspace—and still found it
offered more bandwidth, more disk space, and better support than NTS had
received in the past.

“One of the things I liked about Rackspace was that they always give you
a [dedicated
server](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/),”
he notes. “With smaller companies, you couldn’t tell what you were
getting.”

He notes that the local hosting company NTS initially used had just
three employees. “So every problem had to be solved by those three
people, those three brains. Rackspace seems to have armies of people who
can contribute ideas. If you’ve got a firewall problem, they’ve got
another army.”

The company’s web traffic now averages roughly 1000 transactions a day,
and the increased traffic has never been an issue for Rackspace. Dishman
quickly acknowledges he didn’t know anything about security best
practices when he designed the early NTS sites. Over time,
vulnerabilities were discovered in the way the software interacted with
the hardware.

“Rackspace was very responsive and efficient at shutting down that
problem.” Afterwards, Dishman added a firewall to the site based on
Rackspace’s recommendation and restricted web server login access to
NTS’ own offices.

He has also added more bandwidth and memory from time to time as the
company’s business and web traffic have grown. “We’ve never hesitated to
add upgrades when we think they’re appropriate,” he says. “There’s no
doubt we’re getting good value from Rackspace.” In fact, he says, the
last time he evaluated the cost of NTS’ hosting service from Rackspace,
he was amazed at the value. “The cost of our Rackspace hosting is an
embarrassingly small part of the overall cost of running the company—a
small fraction of one percent. And frankly, the whole company hinges on
it.”

What makes the value even more impressive is the expert and free
[***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/).
“Obviously, customer service is a big part of our own company and its
success. So when I consider what Rackspace has done, I find it very
impressive that they’ve made support such a central focus. Their people
are always helpful and responsive, they never question my actions and
never hesitate to help,” Dishman says. “And they communicate well with
me. To be able to get on the phone when you’ve got a critical issue, and
talk to someone who really seems to know what they’re doing—that’s very
reassuring.”

Dishman says he doesn’t abuse the privilege. If he thinks he can solve a
problem himself, he does. But when he asks for help, he really needs it.
And he’s never been disappointed. “They not only work to solve my
problem until it’s fixed, but they share their ideas and process.
They’re very descriptive. So with any luck, I can learn from them for
the next problem that occurs.”

Looking ahead, Dishman knows that as National Trade Supply grows and
evolves, Rackspace will be more than able to provide whatever
infrastructure it needs. “I’ll probably be a Rackspace customer for
life.”
