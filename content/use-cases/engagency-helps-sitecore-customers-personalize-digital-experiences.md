**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** Engagency helps customers optimize digital user
experiences in Sitecore.

**CHALLENGES:** Searching for a hosting provider that could lower costs
and deliver faster, more accurate diagnostic solutions, with shorter
cycles and fewer delays.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:**
[Dedicated](http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/)
and [Cloud Servers with a Managed Service
Level](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/), [Cloud
Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/?cm_mmc=PPCCA-_-Google-_-broad-_-online+storage+cloud),
[Cloud Load Balancers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Rackspace has given Engagency higher levels of
expertise and responsiveness which have allowed the firm to deliver
consistently stronger diagnostic support and better peace of mind.

### Rackspace specialists help match the Sitecore license to hardware.

Founded in 2002, Engagency is a Web Experience Management systems
integrator, and a Sitecore Certified Solutions Partner. Engagency helps
customers in a variety of industries, including financial, consumer,
retail, education and non-profit, to improve operations by optimizing
and personalizing the thousands of individual digital experiences taking
place on virtually any platform or device. As Sitecore experts,
Engagency provides Sitecore consulting, implementation, personalized
user training and dedicated ongoing support.

“We have worked with Rackspace for years because of the quality of
service,” explains Jason Perry, Engagency President and CEO. “Life at
Engagency without Rackspace would be a lot of sleepless nights.
Rackspace has our back; they’re just as committed to taking care of our
customers as we are. With Rackspace, I know there is always someone
physically there at the data center monitoring whether something’s up or
down and ready to mobilize our support teams when something does go
wrong.”

### Activating the Rackspace Solution

Engagency works with each customer to determine needs in terms of uptime
and availability. Next, a dedicated team of Rackspace specialists helps
match the Sitecore license to hardware.

“Rackspace Digital is easy to work with because they really get
Sitecore,” Perry says. “It’s about identifying the issue and then taking
a proactive approach. We are more confident that with Rackspace, we’re
providing a hosting and service offering which leaves the customer
feeling happy.”

The company also benefits from having much more affordable access to the
latest enterprise technology and expertise that only larger companies
could previously afford.

“Rackspace helps our team of Sitecore experts amplify the level and
quality of the services we provide,” Perry says. “Now we can not only
deliver fast response, but also consistent diagnostic expertise. This
gives our customers peace of mind, an enhanced support experience, and
also ensures round-the-clock reliability.”

### Efficiency Lets Engagency Focus on What’s Next

Rackspace ensures a combination of technological tools and high- level
service which Engagency would not find elsewhere. With Rackspace Cloud,
Engagency is seeing agility increase and its hardware and legacy
investments recede. As a result, people can focus their energies on the
primary work.

“***Fanatical Supporte<sup>&reg;</sup>*** is kind of an understatement,” Perry
says. “Rackspace has perfected the art of going above and beyond. We recently
had a customer that had a DDoS attack while we were rolling out a site.
Rackspace helped us diagnose the problem and then had an immediate
debriefing after the site went live. It led to our starting a whole new
service with DDoS monitoring.”

Engagency plans to move into hybrid solutions as well, according to
Perry. “We tend toward hosting on physical hardware, but have also been
experimenting. We’re eager to see the implementation of more hybrid
solutions in the enterprise space for the future.”
