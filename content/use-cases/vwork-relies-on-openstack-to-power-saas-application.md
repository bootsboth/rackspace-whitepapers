**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** vWork helps companies coordinate mobile employees, job
scheduling and dispatch.

**CHALLENGES:** An expensive, third-party production environment forced
vWork to manage its own data center environment, including costly and
time-consuming hardware upgrades and maintenance.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Managed
Hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/),
[Managed OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup> Cluster](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Better overall performance of vWork, increased
uptime, cost savings, and simplified options for scale-out and scale-up
on OpenStack

**Rackspace helps reduce IT costs and improve performance.**

### Company overview

Based in Auckland, New Zealand, vWork is a business tool which helps
customers operate their businesses more effectively through web
applications in tandem with mobile applications. A SaaS
application, vWork provides job scheduling and dispatch for companies
with mobile field workers.

Jonathan Hoskin, Infrastructure Architect at vWork explains, “vWork is
best suited to businesses with 10 to 100 employees in industries which
require the regular scheduling and dispatching of workers. We serve
hundreds of customers in a variety of industries, in about 50
countries.”

### Eliminating IT overhead

Before moving to Rackspace, vWork hosted server clusters, in a both a
third party data center (for their production environment), as well as
in their own data center (for development). “At peak, we had 15 to 20
servers, plus the entire supporting infrastructure that was required,”
says Hoskin.

But doing business with local hosting providers in New Zealand also came
with a steep pricetag. vWork soon found it was having to manage the SaaS
stack, and the hardware underneath it, and it was also faced with the
capital purchase of upgrades, new equipment, and maintenance.

The company began evaluating hosting providers based on their ability to
scale and support emerging vWorks needs. “We were searching for a
reasonable way to control costs, eliminate expense involving physical
servers, and outsource all the distractions,” said Hoskin. “Rackspace
understood our requirements. We were able to migrate without having to
change many of our existing processes or platforms. And Rackspace
provided outstanding support throughout the move.”

### Improved performance with OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup>

Now operating on Linux OS and the [OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup>
platform](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/openstack_software/),
vWork has observed significant upticks in performance. “We have
seen increased uptime vs. public cloud, and we have simplified
options for scale-out and scale-up on OpenStack,” says Hoskin. “And
our developers enjoy more optimally matched automation in our
self-service environments.”

With the move to Rackspace, vWork has achieved its goal of reducing
complexity and cost in its IT operations and infrastructure. This allows
Hoskin and his development team to remain nimble in a fast-growing
vertical.

“I am regularly amazed at how responsive and capable the Rackspace staff
is. When we require an infrastructure change at Rackspace, we can get it
almost immediately. Our small development team is only viable if we can
remain agile, so having infrastructure that behaves the same way is
crucial. We’re predicting massive growth this year, so we will be
relying on Rackspace to rapidly expand our infrastructure as required.”
