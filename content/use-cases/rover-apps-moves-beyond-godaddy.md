### Loses Trust in GoDaddy’s Email Service

In order to make better use of mobile technology, Rover Apps’ first
product, Rover Retriever, gives small and medium-sized businesses
simple, secure mobile access to information behind company firewalls and
on internal networks. “From spreadsheets to databases to custom-build
applications, there’s still a lot of information left on corporate
servers you can’t access from your BlackBerry<sup>&reg;</sup> or
iPhone<sup>&trade;</sup>. We provide an easy, fast, secure way deploy a mobile
intranet — what we call a ‘rovernet’,” said Jeff Garbers, Founder and CTO of
Rover Apps describing the purpose behind their business. After thirty years in
IT, he’d decided from the outset to use hosting for their website and email
needs.

He used GoDaddy for their website and email hosting. “Everything was
fine until we realized our emails weren’t going through,” says Jeff.
Knowing his way around technology, he knew how to review message headers
when emails he sent weren’t being received. “The headers indicated that
my messages were being refused by the recipients’ servers. We were
blacklisted.” Email providers check incoming messages against aggregated
blacklists of known spam offenders’ IP addresses to determine whether to
send a message to the inbox, junk folder, or refuse it altogether.

“We don’t want to send a follow up email to a prospect that winds up in
the spam folder,” Jeff explains. Mass hosting providers, like GoDaddy,
aren’t focused on business email users. They tend to have softer bulk
email policies that make it easier for spammers to operate. As a result,
GoDaddy’s SMTP servers, the ones Rover Apps relied on to deliver their
outgoing mail, can wind up on aggregated blacklists. “We couldn’t trust
the outbound mail anymore and we couldn’t get any help,” says Jeff.
“Support was usually pretty good, but we contacted them three times and
never got a resolution,” he continues.

Rover Apps was ready to step up to worry-free, email focused on the
demands of business email users.

### Reputation Drives the Best Choice

“I started with Rackspace. I heard the name through their reputation
with server hosting. They had a reputation as a trustworthy company that
didn’t just cater to the Fortune 500 guys,” Jeff says.

After engaging a sales representative with the online chat feature, he
registered a domain to test us out. “The pricing was perfectly
reasonable. We sent out some emails and had no deliverability problems.
That’s when we decided to switch.” He chose Rackspace Email for all of
his mailboxes. Rackspace Email delivers unequaled value. For just \$2
per mailbox, per month, users get a robust web-based interface with
calendar, contacts, tasks, and notes. And, loyal Outlook users can use
Rackspace Email with the [Outlook
client](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/outlook_server/).

Their GoDaddy service was POP. That meant when they checked email from
multiple devices, the changes made on the device weren’t in sync. So,
for example, an email opened and read on the desktop would still be
marked unread on the laptop. With Rackspace Email, they enjoy IMAP
access to sync up email activity across devices for less than they were
paying for POP service with GoDaddy. “We were looking for IMAP access so
that messages were marked read on the iPhone and in the email client,”
says Jeff.

### Better Support and Dependable Service

Rover Apps found the email service their business needed at Rackspace.
They now have IMAP access, no deliverability issues, and immediate
assistance from the [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)
team if they need help. Part of Jeff’s decision to move to Rackspace was our
excellent reputation for support. He can all ready feel the difference
in the level of support. “I needed some help on setting up a catch-all
address. I opened up a live chat and got the information I needed
instantly.” Jeff still hosts his website with GoDaddy, however, he
trusts his email to the dedicated email experts at Rackspace.

Because we focus on business email, Rackspace has a rock-solid bulk
email policy that limits the volume of email customers can send. We take
the reputation of our IP addresses seriously and hold our customers to
standards that ensure the deliverability of all of our customers’ email.
We also have a team dedicated to monitoring activity and taking the
necessary steps to keep our server addresses off blacklists.

“From support to reliability, it just works better,” states Jeff. He
continues, “When you have so much to do, you just want your email to
work without doubling back or troubleshooting.” With Rackspace, Jeff can
concentrate on being an expert on his business, not maintaining the
tools he needs to make his business work.
