### Company overview

In 2006, the British marketing conglomerate WPP decided to bring five of
its agencies under a single roof to create a super-agency, Team Detroit.
Over the past eight years, Team Detroit has evolved from a
marketing-oriented agency into a high-powered development workshop built
to meet the demands of the digital marketplace and provide all of the
services any manufacturing company needs to promote its products, from
marketing and digital media to website development and Omniture
analytics. Today, Team Detroit has more than 1,500 employees and a
diverse portfolio of clients, including well-known brands like Carhartt,
Sports Authority, Bosch, and Scotts Miracle-Gro.

Team Detroit was able to endure the recent recession and auto crisis,
avoiding the financial difficulties afflicting so many in their hometown
of Detroit. The agency has enjoyed steady growth and aims to broaden its
scope even more in the future, with plans to expand into global markets.
Despite these long-term goals, Team Detroit remains committed to helping
its home city bounce back, by supporting arts, education, non-profits
and small businesses within the city.

### A Hosting Platform That’s ‘Always Up’

As a digital marketing agency for major brands, Team Detroit creates
large and complex websites on a regular basis. These sites are often
designed around unique marketing events and require specific features
and capabilities. The agency needed a robust hosting platform that could
meet the needs of even the most demanding sites without any blips in
service, which is what first brought them to Rackspace.

Shan Kumar, Vice President and Technology Director at Team Detroit, says
Rackspace delivered the service they were looking for from the
beginning, and that he’s been routinely impressed with the stability and
reliability of their platform. “We have Flash-based applications which
at times get seven million hits a second,” he says approvingly, “and
Rackspace . . . it just stays there and it’s always up.”

### Rising Above the Competition

Team Detroit hosts multiple platforms with Rackspace, using the [Adobe<sup>&reg;</sup>
Experience Manager](http://www.rackspace.com/wcm/aem/) and a LAMP stack
with multiple websites, also running [Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> SQL
servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/database/supported/)
and MySQL databases, and uses services like load-testing performance
optimization and proactive reporting, recommended by the Rackspace team.
In addition to making technology recommendations, Rackspace digital
experts provide best practices and standards and help Team Detroit stay
on top of security and privacy concerns.

Recently, Team Detroit has also begun using [Rackspace Critical
Application Services
(CAS)](http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise-cloud-solutions/critical-applications),
which provides them with 24-hour support for the many different
technologies they engage with and fills in gaps in their in-house
capabilities. Kumar describes Rackspace as a “one-stop shop” when it
comes to supporting Team Detroit’s hosting and technology needs, and
says partnering with Rackspace has helped them rise above the
competition in an industry where speed is of the essence: “The business
that we deal with today has a lot of competition, and business owners
want results really fast,” he explains. “Because we partner with
Rackspace, we’re able to realize our ideas and concepts and marketing
goals sooner than the business owners even expect. We are able to
provide a brand new experience to the consumer within days because we
engage with Rackspace.”

### Critical Applications Support

Team Detroit has been using Rackspace CAS for only a short time, but the
service has already been good for the agency’s reputation and for their
bottom line. Kumar says the level of expertise on the Rackspace team has
exceeded his expectations: “A good example is the Adobe AEM product
we’re working on,” he explains. “When we sent a CAS ticket to get a
personal contact for advice and consultation, the person who showed up
actually knew more than we did about Adobe AEM, which really helped us,
and he also had proficient server knowledge, so it was a great
combination of application and infrastructure. He was able to help my
system architect, my application architect — all in one person – and
that helped save us time and money.”

Even more importantly, Kumar says the Rackspace CAS experts can provide
a lifeline when their in-house resources are overwhelmed by demanding
technology and tight deadlines. He describes a recent instance that
illustrates the type of invaluable support Team Detroit has received
from CAS: “We were trying to launch one of the biggest web properties
ever and we ran into a pretty significant glitch on a server, which we
were struggling to figure out.”

“All we had to do was send a CAS ticket. We had a specialist on the
phone with us for 10 hours straight, figured out the problem in a day,
and we were golden.” Kumar says in that instance, the support they
received from Rackspace was particularly crucial because they were
working for a new customer and the stakes were high in terms of repeat
business. “The customer was really happy that we were able to pull it
off, but there was a bigger impact,” he explains, “which was the
credibility that we had with the customer, which was under question
because we hadn’t built up trust with them yet. By utilizing Rackspace
we were able to demonstrate our credibility and prove ourselves to the
customer, showing that we’re capable of pulling off any task with flying
colors.”
