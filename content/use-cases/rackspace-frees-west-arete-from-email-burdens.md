**CUSTOMER's BUSINESS:** Software development

**CHALLENGES:** Pulling business resources away from spam fighting &
email maintenance, and on to their business goals.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace
Email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email) for
responsive support and dependable service.

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Retired a server and discontinued LDAP service.



### Solving the Business Email Dilemma

West Arete, a custom software development firm in Pennsylvania, relies
on email for critical system alerts. “About half of our email volume
comes from system status information. Email is the primary notification
vehicle for system alerts; without it, systems could go down and we’d
never know,” says Scott Woods, President and Founder of West Arete.
Email also serves as a main line of communication to their clients.

Fortunate enough to have a very knowledgeable system administrator, they
were able to run email on-premises initially. “Keeping up with email and
spam was a big problem. In order to focus on software development, we
didn’t want to spend time on that,” Scott says. Like millions of other
modern businesses, West Arete decided to try business email hosting.
Unfortunately, the bundled email service with their web host and their
attempt with Gmail didn’t fully meet their needs leaving them in need of
a reliable email to support their business goals.

### Rackspace Email Provides Functionality and Support

“None did as good a job as Rackspace for experience and spam detection,”
says Scott. After his unsuccessful attempts with other email hosting
providers, an internet search led him to Rackspace. “It was a no
brainer. I looked around online forums to see what people I knew and
trusted were saying. The consistent theme was Rackspace has good service
and a good email product.”

They signed up with Rackspace Email. “Rackspace Email completely solved
our email problem and it’s a good value for the money.” Each Rackspace
Email mailbox includes a full workgroup suite including calendar,
contacts, tasks, and notes, all for just \$2 per mailbox, per month.

“The icing on the cake is that the interface is easy, we can access
email anywhere, and customer support is great,” he says. Rackspace not
only helped them solve their email needs, but also provides them with
the documentation they need to help their clients. Our Support Site
documentation compiles hundreds of how-to articles and tutorials in one
convenient place. “Having detailed, step-by-step guides for setting up
email clients was incredibly helpful. When we set up new customers and
they ask, ‘How do I put it on my phone?,’ we can send them the guide or
direct them to an article reducing our support time,” says Scott.

### Consolidation and Reduction of Email-related Expenses

Spam is no longer a menace at West Arete. They’ve been able to
decommission a server and have no need for an external LDAP service. “We
don’t have false positives or downtime, and requests are handled
immediately,” gushes Scott. Instead of spending time troubleshooting
email hiccups, the team at West Arete can contact [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) for
assistance around the clock. “I like having several avenues to get
support. They can be highly technical for a guy like me or help someone
like my Mom, who has limited technical expertise,” explains Scott.

The biggest winner in the move to Rackspace might be the system
administrator. “Rackspace freed up a significant portion of his time, so
he can work on more unique, revenue-generating projects, not chasing
spam and software updates,” says Scott.

“Rackspace provides us with everything we need. It’s rock solid and we
never have to worry about it.” Of his experience with Rackspace, he
states exuberantly, “It’s the perfect email service.”
