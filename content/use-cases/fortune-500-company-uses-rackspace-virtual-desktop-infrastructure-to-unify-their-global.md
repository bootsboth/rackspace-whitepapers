worldwide and consolidate over 1200 applications into a VDI solution

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Citrix<sup>&trade;</sup> Xen Desktop
Services](http://www.rackspace.com/hostedvirtualdesktop/), [Dedicated
Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/index.php), [Managed

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** OS-agnostic capability reduces need to update
hardware; reduced internal IT operations costs

### Company Overview

This use-case is based on the experience of a Fortune 500 Company that
hosts its virtual desktop platform with Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup>.

When it came to their IT needs, thousands of employees around the world
(on multiple types of devices) needed to be connected. In addition, the
company wanted to consolidate over 1,200 applications into a virtualized
desktop environment. Rackspace’s Hosted Virtual Desktop Platform was the
answer. The Rackspace Hosted Virtual Desktop Platform allowed for
simpler provisioning of new desktops, reduced downtime in the event of
server or client hardware failures, decreased costs for deploying new
applications, and provided support for secure remote access.

### SHACKLED WITH RED TAPE

During a trial virtual desktop implementation with another IT provider,
the company ran into numerous delays and challenges. Every detail of the
implementation had to be outlined in a contract in order to execute
their plan. When requirements changed, it took weeks to modify the
contract and gather the required approvals, resulting in delayed
implementation and less than stellar outcomes. When they started the
multi-phased virtual desktop implementation using several of their
executives in a proof-of-concept test, they were disappointed to learn
that the virtualization environment had been shut down without warning.
At that point, they went looking for a partner that was flexible, easy
to work with, and available to support their needs.

### ACHIEVES SPEED AND FLEXIBILITY WITH RACKSPACE

The company’s IT leaders began the search for a cooperative service
provider who would have their business success in mind. They chose
Rackspace.

The company was very impressed with Rackspace’s quick deployment of the
hosted virtual desktop platform that includes hundreds of servers, a
managed storage component, and the network infrastructure to
interconnect it all. Unlike the previous IT provider, Rackspace was
flexible enough to allow the company to quickly change or add new
services. The Rackspace dedicated account team knows the company very
well and can easily support their needs, from sizing a new solution to
addressing any issues within the environment.

The company now enjoys transparency and the ability of the team to cut
through the red tape and address problems in a way that allows a lot of
visibility while providing cutting-edge technology to help shape their
future.

Moving forward, the company will be able to take advantage of desktop
virtualization’s evolving capabilities to connect their global
workforce. Employees can now maintain security through virtual desktop’s
built-in access controls in a way that is efficient for the company’s
internal IT teams to manage and access a large collection of OS-agnostic
applications via iPad, netbook, laptop, smart phone, and other new smart
technologies.
