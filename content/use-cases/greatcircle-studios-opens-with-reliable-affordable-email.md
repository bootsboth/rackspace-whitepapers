### Who to Trust with Email for New Business?

Chief Technology Officer of GreatCircle Studios, John Stanard, has been
involved in website PR, marketing, and software development since 1995.
His current venture, GreatCircle Studios, encompasses his experience
with website design and development to help small and medium businesses
maximize their online presence. Drawing upon his previous experience in
IT, John preferred the outsourced approach to the web servers and email
accounts GreatCircle Studios would be maintaining.

Initially, he and his partner had a great concept and perfect name, but
no website or email. In today’s technology environment, “We didn’t have
a website yet, but we at least needed email to get the ball rolling. We
could’ve piggybacked our email onto some servers I had access to, but we
wouldn’t have had any control over the location or content on the
servers and I didn’t want to deal with email maintenance,” says John.

GreatCircle Studios needed an email provider to support their blossoming
business and allow them to offer email as a service to potential
clients.

### Past Performance Makes the Choice Easy

John was familiar with Rackspace’s services from previous work. “I had
some email domains for a non-profit I needed to put up, so I used
Rackspace and was impressed with the price and the service,” John says.
His initial choice to go with Rackspace was affordability. “Part of the
decision for that project was price. When I landed on your site, the
offer and pricing were clear. When we needed mailboxes for GreatCircle
Studios, I already knew who to call.”

They selected Rackspace Email to support their new venture and offer it
to their clients. Rackspace Email packs a lot of value into \$2 per
month, making it an attractive and profitable proposition for IT
consulting and service businesses. Most importantly, it allows budding
businesses, like GreatCircle Studios, to instantly implement reliable,
professional email with no setup or investment.

John values [***Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/) for
providing him with the answers he needs without having to pick up the
phone or talk to a representative. “I’ve never had a problem getting
what I need. The knowledge base is good. Usually, all I need is a little
direction and I can do most of it on my own. Good support, to me, is
being able to quickly get to self-help documentation,” says John.

### GreatCircle Studios Gets the Best of Both Worlds

GreatCircle Studios can serve businesses of all sizes with Rackspace’s
low minimums and low pricing. “As I see businesses grow into the need
for more inclusive email service, I have a package for mid-sized clients
that includes Rackspace Email,” John shares.

For a minimal monthly investment in email for both his internal needs
and as part of his business offering, Rackspace Email delivers
worry-free email and reliability that would cost thousands of dollars to
implement and maintain. They’re also taking advantage of other IT
offerings in the Rackspace family. The Rackspace Cloud provides their
Linux hosting platform.

John credits ***Fanatical Support*** for his loyalty to Rackspace’s hosting
services. “I’ve never had a bad support experience,” John says. From
small issues, like guidance on setting up email aliases, to big
problems, like DNS validation issues, John found fast resolution and
knowledgeable support with Rackspace. “That DNS issue took a while to
resolve, but I never would’ve figured it out without the support team.”
He can access support via online documentation, live chat, phone, or
email 24×7x365. John describes the best of both worlds when he refers to
his Rackspace services as “affordably dependable.”
