**CUSTOMER'S BUSINESS:** Consulting and outsourcing services for new and
existing Oracle Applications customers

**CHALLENGES:** Overcoming downtime and performance issues

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Exchange
Hybrid](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hybrid/)
with [mobile
services](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/on_your_mobile/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Simple email management and responsive support

### Looking for a Dependable, Responsive Email Host

Many companies using Oracle’s Applications lack the resources or
expertise to implement and support the system once it goes into
production. For over seven years, Tier1 has been providing IT services
for Oracle software services. “We use email for a lot of things. In
addition to project work, we operate a help desk for customers. It’s
important for us to have dependable email that’s always up and
available. There’s a lot of initial communication when a problem arises,
and email lets us know when customers are having problems,” says Rob
Guidarelli, President of Tier1.

They had already decided hosting was the ideal option and had worked
with a few email providers. But, according to Rob, “Our past email
providers had lots of downtime and performance issues. Email was
frequently delayed and we wouldn’t even know it.” Without dedicated IT
resources, “It was important we found a solution that was easy to use,
and we could depend on to be there for us,” says Rob.

### IMAP Access Seals the Deal

The user base at Tier1 is mobile, like most modern businesses, making
IMAP access a requirement for their new email service. “It was important
to me to find an offering with an IMAP solution. The nature of our
business requires that employees access email from different devices on
the go.”

He found Rackspace Email & Apps’ mix of Hosted Exchange and Rackspace
Email met all his needs. Our Hosted Exchange offering delivers the full
functionality of an in-house Exchange configuration without the
maintenance, upgrades, and patching. Rackspace Email is an affordable
webmail client with calendar, contacts, tasks, notes, and free mobile
sync. Rob recalls, “An integrated calendar system was also important. We
looked at customer reference stories and pricing, and you had the best
of the whole bundle.”

Rob is especially happy with the accessibility of his email data. “The
web interface is very easy to use for employees out at customer sites or
from customer laptops. We use a number of different technologies —
Mac<sup>&reg;</sup>, BlackBerry<sup>&reg;</sup>, Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>,
iPhone<sup>&reg;</sup>, and Palm<sup>&reg;</sup> phones — and you provide
great support for all of them. It’s a fully functional email solution
from any computer, anywhere,” Rob says.

### Solid Email Service That’s Easy to Manage

“It’s that easy. You don’t have to be technical to manage it. Everything
is very simple to use. We’re hiring a lot of people right now. It’s so
easy I can have my assistant go in and set up new mailboxes, and add new
users. It’s very simple from an admin perspective,” says Rob.   They’ve
been able to take advantage of having a solid email solution by
converting invoice distribution to an email process, and saving all that
paper. He’s able to do this because, with their Rackspace email hosting
service, “We don’t have to worry about messages not going through in a
timely manner,” Rob shares.

He gives the Rackspace webmail interface high marks. “Your webmail is
equally as good as any mail client out there,” he states. They also use
the shared, online calendars for at-a-glance calendar viewing across the
domain to quickly schedule meetings.

[***Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)
is an integral part of all of our hosting services. Rob states,
“Whatever product or service I buy, customer service and responsiveness
is the most important criteria. In every company, things go wrong. It’s
the nature of the game. But to have a company that will respond quickly,
and be as thorough in their responses as Rackspace is, makes all the
difference.” When he first got his iPhone, he sent an email to support
with some questions and within minutes had an email back with answers to
all of them.

Of his overall experience with Rackspace, Rob states, “It’s one less
thing I have to worry about. We’re an IT company, but thanks to
Rackspace, we don’t need an internal IT department. Knowing our
customers have the ability to communicate with us and contact us when
they need us, is not something I have to worry about anymore.”
