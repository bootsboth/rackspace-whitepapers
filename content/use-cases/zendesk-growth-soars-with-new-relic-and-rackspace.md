### Company overview

With more than 15,000 customers in more than 140 countries,
[Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com/) is a hugely popular cloud-based help
desk system used by companies of all sizes, including Groupon,
OpenTable, Zappos, Gilt, Rovio, and Dropbox, among others. Zendesk’s
goal is to fully democratize the help desk, making it possible for any
company, large or small, to provide superior customer service while also
empowering its customers.

As a growing SaaS company, Zendesk needs to provide its users with
near-perfect uptime, rapid feature rollout, and ease of use. The company
relies on help from Rackspace and New Relic for these things, and it has
paid off: User response has been enthusiastic, with Zendesk frequently
receiving videos and thank-you messages from users testifying that
Zendesk has made their lives easier by providing access to all the
information they need to help their customers.  

### Help desks in the cloud

Zendesk is built for the cloud, with an open architecture that allows
easy integration with a myriad of communication channels, including
email, Facebook, Twitter, mobile phones, web portals, online chat, and
VoIP. The product aggregates individual customers’ communications across
platforms, so service agents can see the whole history of a ticket,
rather than having to view multiple locations or systems.

As Zendesk grew, they discovered that they were moving beyond the
capabilities of their initial hosting environment and turned to
Rackspace for help. “We worked closely with the Rackspace team to build
a modern architecture that would provide the level of performance,
scalability, and security we needed,” says Zack Urlocker, Zendesk COO.

With development teams in California and Denmark, Zendesk embraces an
agile development model to achieve its goals, rapidly rolling out new
services like integrations with Facebook, Twitter, and Windows Phone, in
addition to features like benchmark and real-time reporting. According
to director of operations Tim Sturge, Rackspace makes this speed
possible, providing hardware and taking care of nitty-gritty jobs like
network configurations, so the Zendesk team can focus on user-facing
features.

“Rackspace has enabled us to rapidly expand our hardware footprint while
we maintain control over what kind of services we want to deploy,”
Sturge says. “We’ve been able to avoid a lot of the intricacies around
network configuration and hardware management. We don’t want to have to
spend our time swapping out disk drives.”

Rackspace has also helped increase the software’s speed by providing
Fusion-io drives, which have made a significant performance improvement
in database I/O. Traditional I/O operations read about 200 items per
minute. Fusion-io can read about 200,000 per minute, allowing Zendesk to
use their databases much more efficiently. “Providing us with Fusion-io
has been tremendous,” Sturge says.

### Providing peak performance with New Relic

Help desks are critical to many companies’ operations, and the Zendesk
team knows that any Zendesk performance issue or outage can cause their
customers to suffer. For Zendesk, preventing issues and resolving them
quickly if they do occur is vitally important. Solving performance
issues can be challenging and complex—especially if a company uses a
cloud environment utilizing many different technologies, with a
multitenant architecture, a sharded database architecture, and has
customers on different servers.

Zendesk processes some 60,000 requests per minute (RPM) and 500,000
queries per minute at peak load times. When the team found and tried
[New Relic](http://newrelic.com/rackspace), they were astonished at the
immediate insights they gained into where and how they could improve
Zendesk performance.

New Relic gave the team an easy-to-use, intuitive tool to help them
pinpoint and resolve issues quickly, rapidly becoming the backbone of
Zendesk’s performance monitoring strategy. “It runs all the time, every
day, constantly providing us information on how Zendesk is doing,” says
Sturge. “The New Relic dashboard is excellent at showing us if we have a
performance problem and where it is – database, application, etc. Being
able to take that information and drill down to the source is
terrific.”

“The New Relic Dashboard is up in the office 24/7, so we notice if there
is any blip in our performance,” says Sturge. “We’re big users of the
drill-down capabilities. Transaction traces help us figure out where
things went wrong. New Relic is so ingrained in our process that every
troubleshooting exercise we go through involves using the tool. It’s
part of the Zendesk fabric.”

### A winning combination

Zendesk sees using both New Relic and Rackspace solutions as
best-of-breed providers in their respective spaces – performance
monitoring and hosting platform. The two solutions complement each
other, each contributing to achieving the level of availability and
performance their customers have come to expect and rely on. In addition
to pinpointing performance issues, New Relic shows Zendesk how its
application interacts with the Rackspace infrastructure underpinnings,
so the team can achieve the most effective and efficient use of their
hosting environment.

Uptime is also a major consideration for Zendesk, and Rackspace and New
Relic help the company meet – and often exceed – its published SLA of
99.9% uptime per month. With more than 65 million end users interacting
with the system, the service has to be constantly accessible from any
device, anywhere. New Relic provides the team with great visibility into
performance issues and the ability to quickly find and resolve them.
"Rackspace delivers phenomenal uptime, they have good failover
capabilities, and their communication is outstanding,” says Sturge.

Together the Rackspace hosting environment and the New Relic application
performance tool create a foundation for SaaS application success. In
turn, this frees up the Zendesk team to work on application features.
After all, that’s Zendesk’s objective – to make and deliver the best
cloud-based help desk solution on the market.
