### About Amplifi Commerce

Headquartered in Dallas, Amplifi Commerce is an ecommerce and ebusiness
consultancy whose high-profile roster of clients has included Condé
Nast, Foxhead, Laura Mercier, Lululemon, Sur La Table and Claire’s
Stores. Over the past six years, Amplifi has emerged as a leading
provider of omni-channel commerce and interactive marketing solutions.

The company’s latest offering is Amplifi 360, a managed solution for
clients looking to fully outsource the hosting and management of their
ecommerce environments. The flexibility, high level of customer
engagement and years of experience hosting ecommerce platforms that
Rackspace provides allows Amplifi to offer customized solutions for
emerging, mid-market and enterprise brands.

### Flexibility and Customer Engagement

Amplifi’s CEO, Corey Mellick, describes Amplifi 360 as “a set of
services to help ensure that a client’s site is supported post go-live.
It’s everything from application maintenance and site support services
to monitoring the health of the site on an ongoing basis. It’s also a
robust hosting solution.”

It was essential that Amplifi’s hosting provider have a portfolio broad
enough to support custom configurations and applications for their
clients. “Due to the nature of our business and our clients, Amplifi
requires a hosting provider that is nimble and flexible, a partner who
has the ability to meet our needs today and to scale with our growth,”
says Mellick. “In addition, we require a partner who does more than
support power, ping and pipe. We need infrastructure and application
experts who can support the products they provide and host.”

Amplifi Commerce considered a number of hosting providers, but
ultimately decided that Rackspace should power Amplifi 360. “We went
through a long vetting process and looked at a variety of hosting
providers,” Mellick says. “Regardless of what criteria we ranked our
different prospects on, Rackspace came out on top. Rackspace doesn’t
have a vanilla offering they expect their customers to fit within. They
met us where we were and crafted a solution that was ideal and unique
just for Amplifi 360.”

### Combined Magento Expertise

To meet the demands of emerging to mid-market brands, Mellick says,
“Amplifi Commerce is putting significant focus on the Magento platform
by adding more dedicated resources to the Magento team and focusing on
performance optimization for the core platform. We’re working closely
with Rackspace to finalize a more performant application stack to
maximize performance, increase redundancy and minimize infrastructure
spend.”

A Magento Platinum Partner, Rackspace has architected more than 1000
Magento environments, and this deep knowledge of infrastructure augments
Amplifi’s own years of expertise customizing the platform to suit its
clients’ needs. Brandon Elliott, Amplifi’s Magento Leader, says,
“Amplifi’s Magento solution consists of a fairly complex stack of
software—it’s not just a typical Apache configuration. You have to
tailor the solution to the application, which is where Rackspace comes
in. Rackspace is very familiar with the specifics of Magento, how it
works and what type of performance needs it has.”

In the world of ecommerce, performance is at a premium. A
slower-than-average site not only weakens brand perception, but also
drives customers to speedier competitors. Rackspace provides Amplifi the
redundancy essential for maximum uptime and performance. For Amplifi, a
basic redundant Magento environment might consist of two application
servers and a master-slave InnoDB instance. To scale, additional
application servers and read slaves are added.

When scaling, Amplifi also often adds a caching layer as a
cost-effective alternative to additional application servers. “About
95%, perhaps more, of your traffic is not converting,” says Elliott.
“It’s going to be people looking at the products, the categories, your
content pages, maybe a store locator. This traffic is cacheable. You
actually don’t need the application layer. However, you can’t put a
generic caching solution in place. It’s got to be tailored to the
application, which is where the value of Amplifi and Rackspace comes in.
We’ll work together to make sure that Magento understands the caching
infrastructure. Rackspace will understand that you have caching servers,
and we’ll make sure that all the architecture is using internal networks
so the performance is there.”

### Fanatical Support

Beyond Rackspace infrastructural expertise, Amplifi depends on Fanatical
Support to be able to provide exceptional customer service to its
customers. “It’s integral to the relationship between Amplifi and
Rackspace that we take care of the customer together. That it’s both of
our problems and it’s not pointing fingers,” says Elliott. “Calling at
3am and getting true help, not just a solution putting a temporary fix
in place, but a quick fix as well as a recommendation for a permanent
fix. Those types of calls mean the difference between a longtime
customer and a lost customer. I would definitely recommend Rackspace to
others”

Mellick agrees. “The support we want to offer into the marketplace is
something that Fanatical Support demonstrates time and time again,” he
says. “It’s an ability to deliver for a client regardless of what the
circumstances are, what the request is, what the need is, what the time
of day is—they’re there, and not only do they deliver, but they’re a
pleasure to deal with. Rackspace exemplifies how we want to be seen by
our clients.”
