**CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:** SmartBuyGlasses.com (a subsidiary of Motion
Global Ltd.) is among the world’s leading eyewear ecommerce retailers,
offering the world’s best branded designer sunglasses, prescription
eyewear and contact lenses.

**CHALLENGES:** Position the firm’s offerings for optimal ecommerce
success during routine and peak demand and improve the customer
experience worldwide.

**RACKSPACE<sup>&reg;</sup> SOLUTION:** [Rackspace Managed
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/)

**BUSINESS OUTCOME:** Ensure always-on, secure and scalable ecommerce
performance, with support to solve ecommerce technical challenges and
sustain a high-performance web presence that can scale rapidly during
intense traffic spikes.

### Rackspace helps the global eyewear specialist scale and increase sales.

SmartBuyGlasses.com competes in a value- and service-driven sector where
uptime, customer experience, and responsive service are critical to
success. Based in Shanghai, with facilities in Hong Kong and Italy, the
popular eyewear e-tailer operates multiple sites in 15 languages, in
more than 30 countries.

“Our international development team [of 50] builds and manages an
omni-channel commerce platform across ecommerce, mobile, interactive
media, digital marketing, business intelligence, ERP, CRM and other
web-integrated solutions,” said Tony Zhuang, Co-founder of
SmartBuyGlasses. com. “Rackspace lets us deliver a service our customers
demand, that is also scalable and cost-effective.”

Since 2008, Rackspace has been the foundation of the SmartBuyGlasses.com
infrastructure. More recently, the Rackspace Managed Cloud solution has
enabled the company to improve performance and security, boosting
reliability during peak seasonal traffic.

With help from Rackspace, the organization also stays abreast of
compliance and information security, and follows stringent external
security standards, such as VeriSign SSL Secure. In addition, the
company has a separate Test/Dev and Production environment hosted with
Rackspace.

“We see Rackspace as our strategic partner for long-term success, and
chose Rackspace because the company’s high service level and reliable
global infrastructure met all our needs,” said Zhuang. “We host our B2C
ecommerce platform and our internal CRM and ERP systems on Rackspace
dedicated servers.”

### Smart Growth Delivers with Increasing Customer Demand

During recent holiday seasons, SmartBuyGlasses.com sites experienced the
sort of peak volume which placed considerable strain on internally
hosted infrastructure. To address this, the team approached Rackspace to
address possible solutions to better handle the larger incoming site
volume.

Zhuang points to SmartBuyGlasses.com’s most recent holiday season
performance outcome as the measure of success. “Thanks in no small way
to Rackspace – we achieved the business goal to double sales during the
2013 holiday season. During the holiday promotion, Rackspace dedicated
servers maintained excellent uptime. Now we are working with Rackspace
to find the best way of implementing Rackspace Managed Cloud to
accommodate 2014 seasonal traffic spikes.”

### Managed security, Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup> help site maintain vision

SmartBuyGlasses.com is no stranger to [***Rackspace Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>***](http://www.rackspace.com/about/). For Rackspace, IT
security means safeguarding data and preventing service interruption. “Rackspace
provides IT security products from Firewall and Anti-Virus to Managed
Monitoring and Backup. We feel comfortable and safe to host our websites
and systems under Rackspace safe umbrella.” Said Zhuang.

“For me, ***Fanatical Support*** means any time we are building new servers or
troubleshooting our servers, I can just pick up the phone.

We talk to our Rackspace account managers, implementation consultants
and tech support team all the time on server upgrades, system settings
or new technical solutions to optimize our server performance.”

### The Future is so Bright

To balance traffic globally, the company recently began using Rackspace
Dedicated Hosting in Rackspace global data centers.

“With servers residing locally , it really helps a great deal in
delivering high speed to our local customers,” said Zhuang.

Based on the performance success delivered, SmartBuyGlasses.com plans to
expand their relationship with Rackspace.

“The flexibility of the Rackspace partnership helped our business growth
in many ways during last six years,” said Zhuang. “We will use more
dedicated servers in Rackspace global data centers with the further
growth of our business. And we’re looking into implementing the
Dedicated Server + Rackspace Hybrid Cloud solution.”
