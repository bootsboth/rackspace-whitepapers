### Rackspace powers Optaros’ world-class ecommerce solutions.

Omni-channel ecommerce is increasingly crucial for retail success.
Marrying the UX and design skills of a top-tier agency with the
technology implementation skills of an IT systems integrator,
Boston-based consultancy Optaros helps retailers shift their focus from
traditional media-buying to omni-channel ecommerce, boosting traffic and
conversions through highly customized branded ecommerce solutions.

To win the business and loyalty of today’s fickle consumers, brands need
to provide a world-class, cross-channel experience backed by superior
service and support. Because competitors are only a browser tab away,
24x7 availability and speed are musts. Security is also of paramount
importance for a brand’s reputation. Optaros relies on Rackspace for
hosting solutions that address these and other ecommerce-specific needs.

### Solutions for Every Scenario

Since 2008, Optaros has worked with Rackspace and used a variety of
Rackspace offerings to host highly available and scalable ecommerce
sites.

Miguel Picornell, VP of operations and support at Optaros, says, “When
we first started looking for a hosting provider, we wanted to go with a
top name-brand. Rackspace has an excellent reputation in the market, and
after doing our research, it was almost a no-brainer.”

Optaros CEO and president Robert Willms agrees. “We work with Rackspace
because we believe Rackspace is a best-in-class solution provider for
the kinds of needs that our clients have,” he says. “We typically work
with Fortune 50 or Global 200 customers. They’re looking for
effectiveness, efficiency and a range of services that meet their
specific needs, project by project. Rackspace offers that kind of
solution.”

Optaros makes broad use of the Rackspace portfolio, secure in
Rackspace’s expertise advising on and hosting infrastructure that runs
[ecommerce applications](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/).
Picornell explains, “We use a whole range of Rackspace products:
physical servers, servers in a virtual private cloud, RackConnect setups
where we use both the physical and the Cloud Servers. We leverage the
technical expertise behind the hardware and the servers, both physical
and cloud, and also use Rackspace technical know how in commerce
products, including Magento.”

Regardless of what architecture they’ve opted for, Picornell says,
“Hosting Magento solutions on Rackspace is surprisingly easy. Rackspace
has made it very easy to put all of the pieces in place. They have a
dedicated Magento group with a vast amount of technical expertise that
we can draw on.”

### The Speed and Availability Consumers Demand

Though Optaros recommends different architectures for each client,
availability and speed are top priorities in any ecommerce deployment.
An Aberdeen Group study estimates that load delays can cost ecommerce
sites as much as $117 million in sales a year— companies unable to
offer immediate gratification lose business.<sup>1</sup> Rackspace helps
Optaros clients with five-nines availability and superior performance through
redundancy, flexible architectures that allow for scalability without
compromising performance, and Managed Hosting solutions that provide
response guarantees.

Picornell describes one client solution as “a high-availability
variation on a standard Magento commerce site using physical database
servers and cloud web servers.” RackConnect enables this and other
hybrid architectures, allowing customers to leverage the best of all
worlds—the security and performance of dedicated environments, the
scalability and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud, and the blended
benefits of the private cloud. Customers can host and connect all three
solutions through RackConnect, utilizing a physical connection in a
single data center to eliminate the latency and performance concerns
raised when connecting servers from different providers.

Custom architectures such as this allow Optaros to use Cloud Servers for
bursting, helping their clients weather holiday traffic without
sacrificing performance or security. Picornell reports, “Using on-demand
cloud resources, our customers met their holiday season goals and were
able to handle traffic increases of 250% or more over the holiday
season.”

Security is also a major concern in any ecommerce implementation. As the
No. 1 hosting provider for the country’s top 1,000 retailers, Rackspace
is able to help customers plan for and implement security measures as
well as test measures already in place and make changes to help customer
in their [PCI compliance
efforts](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/pci/).<sup>2</sup> Picornell
says, “Hosting at Rackspace helped with our PCI audit. Rackspace had all
the relevant documentation ready for audit, which simplified working
through all of the sections related to physical hosting and security.”

### Round-the-clock Support

In the retail world, every minute of downtime affects sales. Picornell
says, “It makes a huge difference having a dedicated account manager we
can call 24x7. During the initial [hybrid
cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/)
rollout, we had some reliability issues with some cloud instances,
including a major outage during a load test. One call to our account
manager, and she immediately organized a meeting with all the relevant
engineers and support personnel to identify the root cause and apply a
mitigation plan. We have not had any cloud reliability issues since.”

Rackspace commitment to an [open
cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/open-cloud/) means customers are free to
roam. “I’m not getting locked in,” Picornell says. “We’ve have
deployments in several clouds, including the Amazon cloud, but open
cloud to us means that you can deploy something in a cloud, and if
circumstances change and you need to move, you’re free to do that.”
While Rackspace makes it easy for them to take their business elsewhere
when necessary, its unparalleled service, support and expertise keep
customers like Optaros coming back.

“Rackspace is a trusted hosting provider we would recommend to others,”
Picornell says. “We’ve had an extremely positive experience over the
last five years. They’ve never let us down.”
