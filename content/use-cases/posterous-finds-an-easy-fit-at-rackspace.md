### Company Overview

In 2008, a group of guys wanted to share their musings, photos, and
videos with friends, but they didn’t like how hard it was. Out of that
frustration — and opportunity — Posterous was born.

Now one of the most popular ways to share content with friends and
family, Posterous allows users to create their own public or private
site, by doing what comes most easily — just sending an email.

### Challenges of Their Early Hosting Solution

In 2010, Posterous made the jump from a completely cloud-based
footprint to a hybrid solution, placing some of their heavily-used
database and application servers on dedicated gear. Some of what they
had been running on the cloud was a better match for dedicated servers:
“Since the cloud is multi-tenant, other customers would be sharing our
box at the same time we’d be experiencing a high amount of traffic, and
that would cause performance issues,” says Vincent Chu, director of
engineering at Posterous. That translated into slower load times for
photos being shared. Posterous also used a separate Amazon-based storage
solution for media files.

### Dedicated Servers Predictability and Cloud Flexibility

“The downside of using virtualized hardware became apparent,” remembers
Chu, “So we started shopping around for dedicated services. We looked at
Rackspace, SoftLayer, and a few others and we thought Rackspace would be
better for a dedicated hosting provider. We were pretty happy with
Slicehost, and we knew they were coming into the Rackspace fold.”

Posterous users are sharing their lives globally these days, which
means rich media files must be available around the world, and quickly.
“We were entirely on Amazon S3 for storage, but we’re now considering
moving to Cloud Files because we can see the traction with the CDN
capabilities,” says Chu.

“We realized that we do need a CDN (Content Delivery Network) provider.
We’re approaching the scale of things where having CDN would help site
performance — especially overseas.”

### From Startup to Established Favorite

The media-sharing company has matured from a brilliant startup, drawing
investment from angel investors and venture capitalists, to a core
service heavily used by millions. Their growth has meant hiring
additional employees, and their engineers have put a lot of
consideration into the smartest way to scale. “Bringing it all under one
roof is a huge advantage, ”Chu says of the possible move from Amazon
storage to Cloud Files.

Support flexibility is an important issue to consider. “Earlier on, we
had some issues where we wanted some extra support, and the support
options with Amazon are all or nothing,” says Chu. “Either you are left
to the forums and get no help whatsoever, or you have to spend money for
extra support which was too costly at our
scale.”

### Powering the Long Tail

Posterous’ network of sites attract nearly 11 million visitors a
month<sup>1</sup>. That’s a lot of traffic for any site to handle, but in
Posterous’ case, it’s more complex still. “Our traffic is very long
tail,” says Chu. “In any given two hour window, we serve something like
150,000 distinct files.” Serving all those files quickly, across the
globe, is a perfect use of Rackspace Cloud Files and the Akamai
CDN.

Chu has been pleased with the functionality of the MyRackspace control
panel. “The myrackspace.com reporting tools are pretty mature and give
you a lot of transparency, which lets you see the state of things very
easily,” he says.

### Optimum Choices for Hybrid Hosting

Though they made the move from virtual servers to physical ones last
year, Posterous is considering using Cloud Servers for a growing portion
of their compute hosting in the future. “We’ve decided that we shouldn’t
be completely on dedicated gear. There is a certain class of job that
has to be on dedicated, but not all of it,” Chu explains, “The really
essential beefy stuff, like database or app servers, should be on
dedicated for predictability and performance reasons. But a bunch of our
asynchronous jobs that don’t require super low latency—those things
could go in the cloud. The demand for that infrastructure can be more
spiky.”

According to Posterous, the company’s page views are increasing
dramatically in 2011, and Chu anticipates that their Rackspace footprint
will grow along with their business.
