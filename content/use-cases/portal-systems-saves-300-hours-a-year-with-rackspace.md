### More Time Spent Maintaining Email Than Growing the Business

When a large real estate client came to them with email problems, David
Korte, Managing Partner of Portal Systems, ran the numbers and
determined outsourcing email was the ideal solution. As a result, they
started referring other clients to Rackspace for email hosting, while
still hosting their own mail server in-house.

Over time, they came to realize that, “it doesn’t make sense to waste
time troubleshooting and maintaining our own email,” says David. The 5-6
hours a week they were spending on email maintenance added up to over
300 hours a year. Time better spent creating value for the growing
company, not just maintaining it. Says David, “we were spending an
incredible amount of time with servers, software updates, and battling
spam.” After seeing the positive experiences of their customers, Portal
Systems decided to outsource their email to Rackspace.

### Low Minimums, Easy Transition, and Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup>

Before recommending [hosted
email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/) to their first
client, Portal Systems prepared a report that compared email outsourcing
against in-house hosting. The results of that comparison demonstrated to
Portal Systems and the client that outsourcing email was the best
option. When they went looking for the right email provider for their
client they found us, “Rackspace Email & Apps really stood out because
of the pure focus on email; we were attracted to the fact that your
entire business model revolves around email.” They initially moved over
part of their real estate client’s mailboxes and within a few months,
Rackspace was hosting all of the client’s 300 mailboxes.

Portal Systems referred so many of their customers to Rackspace that
they eventually became a reseller. With the Rackspace Reseller Program,
they can manage multiple domains for their customers. “We were all ready
managing the email accounts for our clients. As a Rackspace reseller, we
could do it all from one [Control
Panel](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/control_panel/) without having to
log in and out of the individual accounts.” Rackspace resellers also
enjoy volume pricing, API integration options, and marketing support.

Our product offerings according to David, “make a lot of sense for our
clients.” Our product choices and low minimums allow David to work with
startups that only need a few Exchange mailboxes to enterprises that
require complex email solutions. Our Exchange Hybrid offering is
especially compelling for his customers as it allows them to mix
Microsoft Exchange and Rackspace Email mailboxes on the same domain.

When they brought their first client to Rackspace, our sales and
Transition Team worked closely with them to ensure a smooth transition.
“We had people to call with questions during transition, it was a great
experience,” recalls David. He specifically credits the support of our
migrations team for ensuring smooth transitions for both Portal Systems
and their customers. “The Exchange migrations guys are very thorough.
They give us the same level of support whether it’s one account or
hundreds and they check back to make sure the mailboxes are functioning
properly.”

### No More Email Worries with Rackspace

Rackspace hosts all of Portal Systems’ email accounts. They use the
hybrid solution for their in-house email with our [mobile
services](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/on_your_mobile/)
for their iPhone<sup>&trade;</sup> and BlackBerry<sup>&reg;</sup> users. Portal
Systems also host about 100 domains for their clients as a reseller. They can
reallocate those 300 hours a year they were spending on email maintenance to
revenue generating activities and leave the maintenance and upkeep to
us.

When they have a question about email service, they can access our
***Fanatical Support*** team. He reports, “we’ve received support ticket
responses at 10:00pm for non-emergency situations.” Most of the time,
they utilize support tickets for resolution. They also have 24×7x365
access to live phone support, chat support, and a library of support
documentation.

The centralized Control Panel streamlines account management. From one
location and with one login, they can add mailboxes, mobile services, or
archiving for any of their customers’ domains or their own. “It’s
designed well and intuitive,” says David of the Control Panel.

David describes his email service with Rackspace as reliable. They
decided to host their email with us because, “we were spending too much
time, money, and resources on email.” Now David says, “it’s nice not to
worry about email.”
