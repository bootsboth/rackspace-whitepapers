### Overview

In 1997, Illinois entrepreneur Jacqueline Berger was looking for a new business
idea--but not just any idea. She wanted what she calls a “bandwagon”
opportunity: a business model so poised to take o that all she’d need to do
was jump on the bandwagon.Berger found what she was looking for. After
purchasing the URL www.LeatherTree.com, she put up a website and began selling
leather goods online. And although she viewed the venture as a hobby at first,
within a year she’d done $200,000 in sales. “I thought that was pretty good for
a ‘hobby,’” Berger says.  She never looked back, and today Berger owns one of
the largest all-leather accessory online stores on the Internet.Getting to
where she is today took some adjustments, however. Berger launched
LeatherTree.com on a shared hosting environment. It wasn’t a viable long term
platform. “The site would crash,” she says. “Sometimes, during the holiday
season, when orders were pouring in, it would go down several times a day.”

### Best value, most positive reviews

So Berger began researching dedicated hosting providers. “I took my time,” she
says. “I discovered that Rackspace had the best value for the dollar, and had
the most positive reviews.” The most important factor in Berger’s decision,
however, was The Rackspace ***Fanatical Support Promise<sup>&reg;</sup>***.
After all, as an online-only retailer, LeatherTree.com is entirely dependent on
its website. And customer satisfaction is a key business priority for the
company. Berger needed to know that Rackspace was willing and able to provide
infrastructure and support to keep the site online and available. The first
test of Rackspace support came during the move from LeatherTree.com’s old
hosting provider. “I was extremely nervous,” Berger says. “So much could go
wrong. The site could go down or get corrupted.”

Her fears proved to be unfounded. “Rackspace worked closely with
my webmaster to manage the move,” Berger says. “It went off without
a hitch — the site remained online and fully functional the entire time."

> ”Moving to Rackspace has paid off hundreds of times over.  I don’t lose orders
due to down time anymore. And customers never experience the frustration of
being unable to view the site or check on orders.” Jacqueline Berger, President
LeatherTree.com
