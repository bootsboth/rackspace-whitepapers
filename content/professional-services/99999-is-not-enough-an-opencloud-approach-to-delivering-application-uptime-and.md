### Executive Summary

The pressure to keep vital applications online and performing well is
extreme. The stakes are high; application downtime means loss of
revenue, and application slowdown means loss of customers.

At the same time, it is hard to achieve end-to-end visibility of
production environments because they span data centers, vendors, and
even internal IT teams. Sometimes the only group that can help
troubleshoot problems for an application is the development team; this
diverts the time of important resources.

As a result, IT departments remain mired in the present, tied to keeping
the application up and running, and expected to avoid problems from the
past. Looking strategically toward the future is a luxury many can’t
afford, despite the constant demands on IT for the newest and latest.

In this white paper, CITO Research examines how [Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Critical
Application
Services](http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise_hosting/critical_applications/)
can help clients achieve end-to-end visibility of their application
environments, maintain high performance, and help prevent applications
from crashing, all at a reasonable monthly cost. With a 100% production
platform uptime guarantee, experienced webscale engineers on staff
offering [Fanatical
Support<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/), and
enterprise-class monitoring tools from CA Technologies offering
end-to-end application and infrastructure visibility, Rackspace Critical
Application Services is a credible and compelling alternative for
achieving top application performance.

### Introduction

One of the major challenges that IT departments face today is
identifying and mitigating application performance problems. When asked
about the most critical issues facing IT in 2013, Sven Hammar, CEO of
Apica, responded this way: “As mobile Internet usage steadily increases
to exceed desktop usage, and as web applications become more complex,
application monitoring and more specifically the ability to detect and
locate the origin of performance problems will be a challenge for IT
organizations. 2013 will be the year when performance monitoring will
shift focus from just ‘Is it up or is it down?’ to providing agile
support for performance status and optimization of applications both in
the cloud and on local enterprise networks.”<sup>1</sup>

Why is this challenge so great? Simply because the consequences of not
addressing it are greater than ever. If an application being down for an
hour results in significant losses of revenue (\$500,000 to \$1 million
or more) or collateral damage to the brand, there can be no question
that application performance is placing a significant stress on the IT
department.

Such high stakes keep IT tied up in the present—trying to keep things
running, and in the past—ensuring that infamous outage from last year
doesn’t happen again, or to our company.

The strain of trying to keep everything running in the face of dynamic
demand indicates a need for end-to-end visibility across environments.
Visibility will enable you to identify problems before they become
problems, and will also allow you to anticipate demand spikes and add
capacity where needed.

CITO Research has determined that IT departments can reap large
efficiency gains from working with a qualified managed operations
provider. In this paper, CITO Research examines Rackspace Critical
Application Services, which offers:

-   100% production platform uptime guarantee
-   Experienced webscale engineers
-   Application performance monitoring for online applications that meet
certain criteria

This may prove to be a cost-effective solution for enterprise IT
departments with one or more critical applications.

### The Strain on Applications (and Enterprise IT)

Enterprise IT departments are already stressed, and this sometimes shows
up in avoidable human errors. Through 2015, 80% of outages impacting
mission-critical services will be caused by people and process
issues—not the failure of the core technology—and more than 50% of those
people/process issues will be change/configuration/release integration
and hand-offs.<sup>2</sup> The developers on critical applications too often
get involved in maintaining or patching the infrastructure, resulting in
less time for developing the app that is driving revenue and a greater
diversion of scarce resources.

Furthermore, IT departments must stay abreast of a barrage of new
developments in technology while maintaining and supporting an existing
complex IT landscape. Often no single person has an end-to-end view of
the application across environments. It spans vendors, it spans
infrastructures (cloud and on-premise), and it spans specialized IT
teams. Many IT departments are split by expertise—here a network
administrator, there a DBA, there a storage expert—and each has a tool
optimized for his individual area. Maintaining a critical application
often requires all of these areas to coordinate with vendors and with
each other.

When there are problems and outside vendors are brought into the mix,
finger pointing results. The end-to-end view is so massive,
interdependent, and dynamic that it is hard to maintain a single source
of information about it.

To top it off, rogue managers often do an end-run around IT and use
credit cards to fund new cloud initiatives, adding further complexity to
the environment and reducing visibility.

Finally, ensuring application performance and uptime translates into a
heavy personal load on IT staff who must be available to provide support
after hours and on holidays.

### Rackspace Critical Application Services: A Cost-effective Alternative

A performance monitoring solution for an in-house production environment
that runs 24x7x365 can easily cost $500,000 up-front, before anyone
works an hour. A consulting firm or systems integrator could create an
application hosting and monitoring environment for a several
million-dollar consulting fee for a six-month-plus engagement, plus
licensing costs of around $250,000.

To provide a cost-effective alternative, Rackspace worked with CA
Technologies to offer Rackspace Critical Application Services. IT
operations improve when Rackspace webscale engineers augment inhouse IT
staff, freeing them to perform tasks that contribute to innovation and
top-line growth.

Critical Application Services provides a 100% production platform uptime
guarantee on approved high-availability environments, something very few
IT departments, let alone hosting providers, can offer. (The production
platform uptime guarantee supplements Rackspace’s traditional 100%
network uptime guarantee.) Using monitoring tools from CA Technologies,
Rackspace’s experienced webscale engineers monitor and manage all layers
of the stack, including applications, operating systems, servers, and
networking. This experience is enveloped within Fanatical Support:
employees devote themselves to ensuring an excellent customer
experience, are intimately conversant with their customers’
environments, and directly answer phone calls from clients.

### An Extension of the IT Team

Rackspace Critical Application Services saves time, money, and personnel
effort for IT departments striving to support high-performance
applications. IT departments are viewed as cost centers, yet are always
being asked to do more. Saddled with maintaining, configuring, and
patching existing IT assets, IT is also being asked to help the business
launch tomorrow’s cloud, social, and mobile apps, often with yesterday’s
budget and staff. When experienced staff leaves, they aren’t always
replaced, and their experience and knowledge walk out with them. Fewer
resources mean heavier workloads, less time, and lower levels of staff
experience. Under pressure to do more with less, IT struggles with
managing multiple vendor environments, including a near-constant barrage
of patches, upgrades, and requests to provision resources while juggling
business requests to launch new applications and services.

For example, the CA Technologies suite of applications help Rackspace
identify any application component that causes trouble—even those that
are not owned by Rackspace or the customer. That means IT spends less
time putting out fires and more time working on innovations that drive
the business forward. Rather than license CA Technologies or a similar
platform and attempt to deploy their applications on their own hardware,
with all the maintenance and support time that implies, enterprise
customers can simply deploy the support, managed operations environment,
and monitoring service as a complete package, letting Rackspace become
an extension of the IT team—the part devoted to “keeping the lights on”
and reducing IT stress. Rackspace can take the call at 2AM when there’s
a problem with your high-end production environment instead of someone
on your staff. Ray Velez, Global CTO of Razorfish said, “Rackspace isn’t
just another one of our vendors; they are partners and an extension of
our team. They treat our clients’ needs as a top priority, and move at
an agency’s pace. The countless hours they spend helping us architect
the right solutions, and their desire to help us work more efficiently
is just a small part of their first-class Fanatical Support.”

### Anatomy of a Guarantee

Rackspace Critical Application Services offers a dedicated team of
webscale engineers, application and infrastructure performance
monitoring, and ongoing optimization and guidance on deployments. Their
approach to application and infrastructure monitoring is threefold:

-   **Infrastructure Discovery** - The team and its technology automatically
discover infrastructure and map the relationships between infrastructure and
the applications it serves. This step is key to providing end-to-end support.
Armed with a complete and up-to-date picture of the infrastructure, Rackspace
can advise developers about dependencies when new components are deployed.

-   **Proactive Performance Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis** - Using CA
Technologies’ industry-leading root-cause analysis models, Rackspace webscale
engineers can correlate thresholds and alarms and predict performance issues in
advance. The team can pinpoint potential issues anywhere in the stack, from the
transaction layer and end-user experience down to network switches. If they
don’t meet their first goal, which is to isolate and fix problems before the
customer picks up the phone, the team then helps IT prioritize, triage, respond
to, and remediate the issue. Critical Application Services gives IT 360-degree
visibility across the entire application and hardware stack.

-   **Traffic Analysis and Predictive Capacity Planning** - The team works to
understand net- work and application behavior, including application and
resource consumption rates, allowing them to predict performance bottlenecks
before they happen. Rackspace also works with procurement to provide hard data
about where resources will be needed given application trending, data that can
also show where resources can be redeployed or decommissioned if the application
is over-provisioned.

The Rackspace Critical Application Services team has been building
high-availability Managed Operations solutions with CA Technologies for
several years and has developed high-performance reference architectures
that can support a wide array of applications and infrastructures, both
[dedicated](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/)
and
[hydrid](http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/),
on-premise and [in the cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/).
Rackspace Critical Application Services also includes support for
particularly challenging platforms that require multiple instances or
extensive configuration. Figure 1 shows how Rackspace Critical
Application Services provides end-to-end visibility.

### CA Technologies' Capabilities

While it’s certainly possible to assemble a toolset from scratch, it’s
not likely to be cheaper or faster than doing so through Critical
Application Services. Very few enterprises have CA Technologies’ ability
to support both network-aware application management and
application-aware network management—which together offer a complete
understanding of how application demands affect the performance of the
network and different network configurations affect applications.

CA Technologies is deployed in ten of the largest banks in the US, with
good reason. The company is known for its patented, model-based root
cause analysis library, with more than 10,000 pre-defined issue models.
These models are built into each component of the CA Technologies suite,
and Rackspace’s webscale engineers are trained to use them. This can
substantially reduce mean time to repair—whatever the problem is,
Rackspace webscale engineers have probably seen it before.

Rackspace chose the CA Technologies suite for two reasons:

-   It provides capabilities for monitoring across data centers, so applications
that cross environments can be effectively managed, essentially offering a
single pane view into performance.
-   It provides comprehensive capabilities to monitor everything that the
Rackspace webscale engineers need to see in order to support the complete
application stack.

Because the CA Technologies suite is comprehensive, it is also complex
and difficult to implement on your own, requiring multiple admins in
addition to software licensing costs and ongoing maintenance. Use of the
CA Technologies suite is built into the Critical Application Services
offer, which costs roughly the equivalent of one full-time employee per
year.<sup>3</sup>

The following components of the CA Technologies suite are built into the
Rackspace Critical Application Services offer:

-   Wiley is an application performance management (APM) component that
measures transaction performance. Wiley understands all of the implications of
a transaction in a given application from the end user to the data center. It
can dissect, analyze, and determine the root cause of transaction failures as
well as detect potential failures and predict performance degradation.

-   eHealth is a network performance monitoring (NPM) solution that tracks
bandwidth utilization, processor utilization, and errors in hardware at the
infrastructure level. eHealth detects and predicts problems with routers,
switches, servers, and load balancers and communicates issues that are likely
to impede application performance. Heuristic analysis of each part of the
infrastructure at time intervals allows the team to observe how an
infrastructure failure may affect one or more applications, enabling proactive
resource allocations that can head off crises.

-   Spectrum is an event aggregation and correlation agent. Spectrum models the
entire application stack and uses the model to identify events and calculate
their impact. It collects native hardware and OS alerts as well as signals from
Wiley and eHealth and isolates the root cause of issues that would take hours
to diagnose by other means.

### Been There, Done That

The Rackspace Critical Application Services team devotes itself entirely
to fully understanding customers’ performance requirements, application
environment needs, and dependencies and builds out an appropriate plan
to monitor and optimize performance efficiently. As a result, the IT
professional can focus on his customers, not his infrastructure.

The experience of the Rackspace team, in not only the CA Technologies
platform, but all platforms used in the stack, means enterprise IT can
be relieved of staying on top of the latest solutions, patches, and
upgrades. Rackspace’s experienced team and proven technologies have been
validated by the industry. With more than 190,000 customers and $1
billion in annual revenue, Rackspace ranks as the leader in the Gartner
Magic Quadrant for managed hosting providers, for the sixth year in a
row. With 190,000 customers, the Rackspace webscale engineers have seen
almost any kind of problem you can imagine and know how to resolve it.

As a proactive complement to IT departments, Rackspace Critical
Application Services can offer the agility required of “startup”
projects, with the visibility and control offered by CA Technologies,
predicting peak loads as much as three weeks in advance.

With enterprise-class CA Technologies application and network
performance monitoring, customers can take advantage of this combination
of support, expertise, and tools, maintaining critical applications for
less than the cost of acquiring the application and network performance
monitoring tools on their own. Instead of having a shared IT service
environment, the business gets a dedicated team focused on key
production environments. Instead of finger pointing and delays in
resolving a complex, multi-platform, multi-vendor issue, there is one
number to call, even at 2AM, and there is always someone at Rackspace
who knows the details of the specific deployment on the other end of the
line.

In addition to saving money, IT saves time. Critical Application
Services has the visibility to precisely pinpoint problems, letting the
remediation, whether a different SQL statement or replacement of a
lagging server, be handled as quickly as possible. Instead of trying to
take on everything with limited resources, IT can refocus high-value
personnel on key projects to drive the business forward and avoid having
developers troubleshooting infrastructure.

The fact is that for the most part, IT is constantly forced to stay in
the present, keeping everything running. With expertise from Rackspace
Critical Application Services, IT can turn to the future and work on
strategic efforts and innovative new projects. (Several Critical
Application Services clients have found that they now have time to build
the mobile applications everyone has been asking for.) IT can focus on
analysis and providing recommendations to the business, rather than
simply monitoring and collecting data. They get access to experienced
webscale engineers who speak their language and have expertise in the
tools they use. In essence, outsourcing performance monitoring of
critical applications allows IT professionals to sleep at night—for
many, it could be the first good night’s sleep in a long while.

### Conclusion

Business users, partners, and consumers expect instant gratification
from their online applications, and the pressure is on IT to provide it.
Charged with cutting costs, adding new skills, testing and configuring
new products, and monitoring and maintaining the technologies they
already have, IT departments are stressed.

CITO Research has determined that Rackspace’s Critical Application
Services offers a credible and compelling solution by transferring the
most laborious and complex tasks of IT to a monthly service. Rackspace
Critical Application Services combines a high level of support and
expertise, including a 100% production platform uptime guarantee, with
experienced webscale engineers and best-in-class monitoring technology
that is normally out of reach for all but the largest enterprises. With
solutions such as this in place, IT departments can return to designing
and delivering innovative projects that create top-line value for the
business and looking to the future, planning strategic initiatives. As
Vashdev Vangani, Department Manager of Information Technology at Mazda
North American Operations said, “The Critical Application Service team
is a huge value-add to my business. Before, we had to react; now, we can
proactively scale for future demand.”

Aided by the expertise of two Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders, IT
organizations can get affordable help in keeping critical revenue
producing applications online and running at peak performance.
