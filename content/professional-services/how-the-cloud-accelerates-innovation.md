### Introduction

How can IT effectively support innovation? The right way to support
innovation varies dramatically depending on the context. Innovation in
medicine or oil exploration begins with research and proceeds through a
lengthy process of development and testing. IT can support this sort of
innovation, but the basic research is the main event.

The bulk of innovation we hear about today is much easier than the kind
of long-term innovation just described. For most businesses, innovation
means first gaining an improved understanding of product offerings or
key processes, then what to change to get a better result. The
implementation of the innovation almost always becomes an IT project. In
other words, the last mile of most innovation that makes a difference
goes through IT. Often innovations are perfected in many short
increments using agile methodologies, which again makes the malleability
of IT a crucial factor.

Leading organizations have recognized this linkage. They have asked: How
long does it take to provision new servers, data centers, and
applications? How much will that cost? Can we afford to add IT personnel
and equipment to support short-term experiments?

It stands to reason then that if IT can be deployed, configured, and
adapted faster, it will spur innovation. Adopting cloud-based IT in
various forms is an important factor in accelerating innovation.

Today’s most innovative companies encourage curiosity and ingenuity at a
low cost by exploiting the flexibility of
[cloud computing](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/what_is_cloud_computing/).
Building a new data center is cost-prohibitive, but the cloud lets you
scale economically. With a self-service model enabled by the cloud,
users can innovate and solve their own problems, empowering themselves
and freeing IT for more strategic tasks.

You can spend a lot more time innovating new products when you don’t
have to spend time provisioning, managing, and maintaining
infrastructure. Increased adoption of cloud computing accelerates
innovation.

In this paper, we’ll show you the many ways the cloud makes IT more
responsive to innovation in different parts of the innovation cycle:

**Eliminating IT Roadblocks**
-  The cloud helps you innovate faster. Computing resources are
available in a snap.
-  Business users don’t have to wait for IT to provision
infrastructure for their initiatives—they can get started in minutes,
instead of weeks or months.

**Emancipating IT, Increasing Agility, Attracting Talent**
-  The cloud reduces the effort to maintain IT systems. When you host
email and file sharing in the cloud, IT staff can focus on more
strategic projects.
-  Because cloud hosting companies focus solely on managing IT assets,
they often provide better visibility into performance than in-house
hosting can.
-  Because the cloud is clearly on the rise, adopting cloud technology
can increase your ability to attract top talent.

**Supporting Success through Access to Elastic Resources**
-  The cloud provides access to scalable computing resources, such as
processor power, RAM, and disk space, allowing you to handle traffic
spikes confidently.
-  When an innovation is successful, there is a clear path to massive
scalability.

**Increasing Choice, Leveraging Ecosystems**
-  Recent initiatives around creating open-source cloud software are
clearing the decks for innovation without fear of vendor lock-in.
-  Open standards are shedding light on new approaches to creating
lightweight, more stable, and better performing applications.
-  Your organization can benefit from the collective innovation of all
the companies that are hard at work coming up with new ways to make the
cloud more useful.

### Eliminating IT Roadblocks

The cloud is a new way of delivering IT. It shifts technology tasks that
keep the company humming—but don’t add value—off the shoulders of the IT
department. When developers and users diagnose server malfunctions
instead of designing new products, that’s a lost innovation opportunity.
When IT infrastructure bottlenecks slow development access to new
resources, you lose competitive edge. **Nearly 75% of IT budgets just
support the status quo.<sup>1</sup>** The more you reduce that percentage, the
more time and money you have to change the game.

By moving to the cloud, with the same budget and resources, you can
experiment with a longer list of ideas. If you transfer key segments of
your IT estate to the cloud, where it can be run by vendors whose
business model revolves around it, your best minds can get back to doing
what you hired them to do—turning on light bulbs over their heads, not
just “keeping the lights on.”

**Speed Deployment, Development, and Testing**

The cloud lowers barriers to experimentation and can speed deployment
and testing of new projects that otherwise might have died on the vine.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** affords the benefits of running an
application from a central location on a one-to-many model—everyone who
needs to use it can access it from the Web, without the need to deploy
to individual machines. Users and IT don’t need to worry about patches
and upgrades. Because only one version exists, managed by a single
company, the application can evolve faster and it runs better because
needed expertise is centralized.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** provides a set of APIs and a
development environment for building cloud-based applications. It can be
used to design, test, and deploy applications without the cost and
complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software,
which means deployment moves faster. Users can create, deploy, scale,
maintain, customize, and test web-based applications without heavy IT
involvement.

One layer below, **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** allows the raw
materials of computing to be created, used, paid for, and retired on an
as-needed basis. Resources such as servers, software, storage, data
center space, and network equipment can be provisioned through web
interfaces or APIs. The elastic computing power of IaaS allows you to
meet peak demand, without having to overprovision “just in case.” When
infrastructure provisioning and use is this straightforward, there is
much more room to innovate at a much lower cost.

### Emancipating IT, Increasing Agility, Attracting Talent

Through the cloud, IT can provide high-performance computing to users,
without the heavy lifting of on-premise provisioning. The cloud also
takes away some of the responsibility of creating applications from IT.

In addition, cloud services provide more transparency into the
consumption of computing resources than on-premise architectures, making
it possible to see who is using what resources and better understand
their usage patterns.

The on-premise IT model comes with the following constraints:

-  Limited flexibility to roll out new services
-  The pressure to fix broken applications and tend to technical problems,
which make it difficult to find time to develop new, value-added business
applications
-  The grind of managing contracts with providers and maintaining software and
hardware

Because the cloud removes these constraints, IT is freed up to
co-innovate with business users, building applications and solutions
that truly differentiate the organization and bring real value.

#### Manage Complex and Fast-Changing Resources

The cloud makes it easy to manage a complex application portfolio.
Because apportioning and managing resources on-premise is no longer an
issue, applications can be deployed more easily, reducing the cost of
trying new things. Additionally, upgrades, patches, and changes to
commercial software become the responsibility of the cloud vendor. Cloud
vendors can automate deployment and management of basic apps while your
team works on new apps that provide differentiation. Further, some cloud
vendors can track application usage, storage and memory requirements,
and CPU loads. They offer monitoring solutions that can help with
security issues and alert you when resources are becoming overtaxed.
Because of the way cloud architecture is instrumented, more information
may be available in the cloud than on-premise.

Here are a few examples of rudimentary tasks that can be transferred to
the cloud:

-  **Email.** [Hosting email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/) in
the cloud can help provide continuity for users, reducing the risk of downtime.
Let’s face it: no one distinguishes themselves based on how well they host email.
-  **Backup.** Storage and backup needs are increasing. Maintaining on-premise
file servers is expensive and offers little differentiating value.
[Cloud-based storage](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/)
allows you to share and sync data with the cloud without maintaining file
servers. It moves data offsite, which also supports disaster recovery.
-  **File sharing.** Many enterprises use file-sharing applications such as
[Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> SharePoint<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/sharepoint/)
to manage documents and collaborate. In the cloud, a SharePoint installation
can be proactively monitored and maintained by experts.

#### Pooling of Expertise

With cloud adoption, you stand to benefit from the collective innovation
of all the companies that are hard at work coming up with new ways to
make the cloud more useful for both the most ordinary and extraordinary
computing circumstances.

When you detach your own product and service innovation from the grind
of maintaining infrastructure resources, it might be tempting to forget
that innovation is still happening on the infrastructure side—but it is,
and that’s important. Cloud vendors bear the cost of upgrades to
systems, leaving more of your money for innovation. They routinely find
new ways to make cloud infrastructure more efficient, while staying on
top of current issues. When it’s time to make a change, automated
updates, security patches, and version upgrades happen seamlessly,
making the transition invisible to the customer. Yet the benefits soon
become obvious: speed, lower costs, easier access, and the elimination
of the upgrade and versioning hassle.

#### Attracting Talent

The trend toward cloud adoption is no secret. The most talented
engineers and developers are seeking to increase and develop their
skills. A declared strategy to make the most of the cloud can help IT
departments attract the best talent, who then can help accelerate
innovation.

### Supporting Success through Access to Elastic Resources

The ability to consume resources in short bursts is vital for many
companies, particularly as business fluctuates episodically through
seasons, economic conditions, or events. With the crush of “big data”
from thousands of information sources powering applications that support
decision-making and new product development, many companies find
themselves in need of more computing power—fast. Many businesses can’t
afford to buy more servers to meet peak demand. The cloud lets you scale
and innovate using heavy-duty computing power without having to buy it
or lease it long term.

Consider [AgencyNet](/how-to/rackspace-keeps-nickelodeons-kids-choice-awards-virtual-slime-flowing),
a digital content agency that specializes in creating marketing plans.
In 2011, AgencyNet developed a Facebook application for the Nickelodeon
Channel’s Kids’ Choice Awards. The chief currency of the Nickelodeon
world is “slime,” a gooey concoction flung at game-show winners and
guest celebrities. As the host of the KCA, AgencyNet needed to
accommodate a potentially huge traffic surge, with fans slinging virtual
“slime” on their favorite videos and websites. AgencyNet estimated that
the traffic could comprise 20% of its total volume.

The company turned to Rackspace to host its Facebook app because of its
ability to provide on-demand, scalable support for cloud applications.
Not only did Rackspace’s web servers help the app take off like a shot,
earning 25 million impressions; AgencyNet also used Rackspace’s
CloudKick monitoring and management service to access all the monitoring
data so that they could spin up more Cloud Servers if there was an
unexpected traffic spike. AgencyNet used Rackspace’s storage capacity to
record the feedback. Site response times were extremely fast, despite
the traffic spike. And, when the contest ended, AgencyNet could stop
renting the servers, providing substantial cost savings.<sup>2</sup>

The cloud lets you scale and innovate using heavy-duty computing power
without having to buy it or lease it long-term.

### Increasing Choice, Leveraging Ecosystems

IT departments must be careful as they adopt the cloud in support of
innovation. Selecting the wrong platform could result in less choice,
not more innovation. In other words, the specter of lock-in still looms
when adopting cloud infrastructure.

Open clouds increase the choice of vendors to help your organization
build and maintain new applications. With open-source technologies such
as OpenStack^TM^, which enables any organization to create
cloud-computing services on commodity hardware, the collective
development efforts of the cloud community offer rich possibilities. The
move to open source the cloud is sparking a revolution on par with the
rise of open source software.

The open cloud has a long-term effect on innovation. Because more energy
from more vendors is applied to an open ecosystem, new capabilities
arrive faster than with proprietary alternatives. The rise of the open
source Linux operating system illustrates this clearly.

Open standards also lead to interoperability, which increases the
ability to mash up many different services to meet new needs.

#### Open Cloud Initiatives

There has been a recent increase in cloud vendors’ willingness to share
innovations through open standards.
NASA, [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/), and 20 other organizations
joined to form [OpenStack project](http://www.openstack.org/), an open
source community devoted to building a cloud operating system. A wave of
open standard innovation projects have also emerged, such as Facebook’s
launch of the Open Compute Project, a community effort to create
low-cost, green data centers. VMware followed later with Cloud Foundry,
a multi-language, multi-platform service for building scalable cloud
solutions, whose code has been released to the Apache 2 developer
community. Now, OpenStack community members are working on ways to tie
all of these components into one system. These and other initiatives are
driving a new paradigm of innovation around the cloud, creating new
products, services, companies, and jobs.

#### Leveraging an Ecosystem

The sort of ecosystems that form around cloud-based IT have several
positive effects on innovation. First, the ecosystems attract services
partners, who can help put cloud technology to work. Second, if the
cloud-based IT is based on open source, independent software vendors
provide missing features and functions. Third, a cloud ecosystem can be
come the focus for the energy of numerous companies, who can work
together to make the offering better at a speed none of them could
achieve working alone.

As an example, the OpenStack community includes some of the largest and
most significant computing vendors. Each provides technology that can
help enterprises start innovating in the cloud, faster:

-  Microsoft contributed support for the Hyper-V server to help migrate
enterprise virtualization projects to the cloud.
-  Citrix added support for XenServer and will soon support VMware ESX.
-  Dell, Intel, and AMD are optimizing their hardware to run the OpenStack
platform and determining the best specifications to run an OpenStack cloud.
-  NTT DATA Group added support for IPv6.
-  Opscode is writing automation scripts to more easily launch projects and
assign resources to the cloud.

These participants and others are helping integrate the OpenStack
platform at the enterprise level. Just as the cloud, in general, removes
the bottlenecks to innovation imposed by the on- premise IT model, the
OpenStack community is doing its part to ensure that commercial cloud
vendors don’t present roadblocks to innovation. If enterprises can avoid
being “locked in” by a vendor’s upgrade path or compatibility with other
vendors’ products, the road to innovative software in the cloud becomes
less like a bumpy towpath and more like an airport runway— smooth and
cleared for takeoff.

### Conclusion

Adopting cloud-based IT doesn’t guarantee that your company will invent
the next touch pad. But it can eliminate the most preventable IT
roadblocks to innovation. In this way, cloud-based IT shifts time and
money away from business-as-usual and toward game-changing innovation.
Business users and developers can scale resources up and down as needed,
freeing IT to spend more time creating and less time configuring. IT is
enabled to better manage widening portfolios of applications while users
are free to experiment within limits set by IT. In the cloud, the new IT
paradigm is simplicity and flexibility, and your people can illuminate
new ideas, not just keep the lights on.
