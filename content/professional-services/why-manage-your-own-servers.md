### Introduction

It’s a tough time for most CIOs, suffering the worst budget crunch of
their careers. In a recent survey by CIO magazine, two out of three CIOs
admitted the recession meant more scrutiny of their budgets. Gartner
reports 88% of all enterprises reduced IT budgets during 20092 ... and
more than half froze IT budgets or made additional cuts in 2010. **This
white paper is intended to help CIOs under budget pressure, by:**

-   Defining the new era of “IT 2.0” and what it means for CIOs
-   Describing a time-tested way to focus on key strategic activities
-   Suggesting one item you could easily outsource: managing your own servers.

### What is Web 2.0?

As you know, Web 2.0 is quickly transforming business-as-usual into
something new. A younger generation who grew up with the web expects to
use blogs, Facebook<sup>&reg;</sup>, forums, LinkedIn<sup>&reg;</sup>,
Twitter<sup>&reg;</sup>, wikis and every other cool new web-based service at
work. As the leading edge of the Baby Boom starts hitting 65 in 2010, no one
can deny it any longer: a younger generation is taking over. And that younger
generation includes both your employees and your customers. IT has to adapt, or
become irrelevant. In the era of IT 2.0, your users and customers don’t want
excuses; they want instant access to anything, anytime, anywhere. And if
you don’t give it to them, someone else will: Your users will sign up
for SaaS or free web services, and your prospects will click away to
another site. That means IT managers must evolve from geeky engineers
into service-oriented business analysts. “The IT leaders of tomorrow,”
blogged Sarah Perez in a seminal posting, ”the ones working with the
CEOs to execute the vision and direction via IT, will no longer be...
the classic computer geek. To become an IT leader of tomorrow means more
than tolerating Facebook and Twitter. It means becoming a lot savvier
about where to focus your efforts and your budget to help boost your
company’s bottom line.

### Core vs. context: Making a real difference

The ultimate factor driving IT change “will be the long-developing trend
toward companies hiring only the professionals who serve the core
competencies of their business, and outsourcing everything else.” says
the editor-in-chief of TechRepublic. This is not news. This trend was
described a decade ago by technology guru Geoffrey Moore in his book
“Living on the Fault Line.” He made a key distinction between core and
context; in his view, core is anything that gives your firm an essential
competitive edge. Everything else is context. “For core activities, the
goal is to differentiate as much as possible on any variable that
impacts customers’ purchase decisions, and to assign one’s best
resources to that challenge,” he wrote. Core is the key to success.
“Every other activity in the corporation—and this is typically the
overwhelming bulk of all activities—is not core. It is context,” notes
Moore. “And the winning approach to context tasks is not to
differentiate, but to execute them effectively and efficiently in as
standardized a manner as possible.” That’s why SaaS is so successful in
areas like email, payroll, sales force automation, and HR. These are all
routine chores, so there is no loss of competitive advantage if you do
them the same way everyone else does.

### The IT department needs to ficus on the core

The point is: IT needs to stop wasting money on things that don’t
matter, and focus on the few areas that make customers buy. IT needs to
focus on the core, as shown in Figure 1. The best investment of the IT
department’s time, energy and money is in the green zone: in a few
selected projects, activities, and line items that make a real
contribution to your company’s success. Everything else can be
outsourced, and it won’t make a big difference. The truth is, no one
cares that you replaced a server over the weekend. That kind of routine
maintenance doesn’t give your company an edge. Sorry, that’s just part
of the scenery that everyone else takes for granted, like cleaning the
office. That’s bad news if you’re still managing servers, or renting
space in a data center around the corner, with your team wearing pagers
to take those emergency calls in the middle of the night. Where would
your management team place those expenses? In the green zone, as a wise
investment that adds to the business success? Or in the red, as a good
prospect for a budget cut?

### Cut and grow at the same time?

Gartner notes that CIOs are now being pulled in two directions at once:
“The business needs cost savings to protect financial results—yet it
also needs new solutions to retain current and attract new customers.”

**But how is it possible to cut and grow at the same time?** The surest
way is to go through your budget and outsource as many routine
activities (context) as you can. Then focus like a laser on the core
activities that truly make a difference:

-   New products and services
-   A more effective web presence
-   Speeding up transaction-processing
-   Anything else that gives your enterprise a competitive advantage

Otherwise, someone else may do this for you. For example, your
management team probably doesn’t count maintaining your own servers as
mission-critical. So why keep on doing it?

### Looking good on your budget

These days, you can move your servers to an innovative form of
outsourcing called managed colocation that will cut several line items
from your budget. In true managed colocation, the service provider takes
care of all the hardware, networking, and other devices you need in the
data center. You lease this equipment, you don’t buy it. At the same
time, you maintain control of your software environment, including your
OS and your apps. Since you can manage your software remotely, you no
longer need to be close to your data center. That opens up a wider pool
of service providers to choose from, and enables you to select one based
on more important factors than its location. All this will look good on
your budget, and help you focus IT efforts where you make the biggest
difference. That will buy you more respect from the bean-counters, from
your people and from your customers.
