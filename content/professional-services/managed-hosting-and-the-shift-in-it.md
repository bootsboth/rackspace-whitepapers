### Introduction

The rise of [managed
hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/index.php) and
the [cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/) have
sparked much speculation among IT professionals. Do these help or hurt
IT job prospects? Are IT departments in danger of being shut down? How
can IT cope with these new trends?

It’s an emotional debate, with no firm statistics to settle it. For
example, figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics do show a
10-year decline in full-time employees in the “information” and “data
processing” sectors, but these numbers are not granular enough to answer
these questions.<sup>1</sup>

A recent survey by UK IT placement
firm<ins cite="mailto:%20Lizetta%20" datetime="2011-05-05T13:56">,</ins> CW
Jobs<ins cite="mailto:%20Lizetta%20" datetime="2011-05-05T13:56">,</ins> was
more positive. After querying 1,300 IT pros, this study concluded, “More
IT jobs are likely to be created as a result of the rise of cloud
computing services such as managed hosting... 75% think that cloud
computing skills will make them more employable.”<sup>2</sup>

Whatever the exact stats, everyone agrees that IT is going through a
shakeup due to the recession, the cloud, and outsourcing. How can a CIO
deal with these changes?

This white paper proposes three steps: First, acknowledge the need for
change. Next, answer these two provocative questions posed by The
Standish Group. “Are you working on the right things, and are you doing
them in the right way?”<sup>3</sup>

### Step 1: Acknowledge the need for change

It’s no secret the economy has gone global, business moves faster than
ever, and almost every company is facing new competitors.

“Most industries are in a state of profound change, where businesses
are having to accomplish new levels of productivity and sources of
revenue simply to survive, let alone grow... Chances are someone else in
your industry is vying to deliver what you do at lower cost.”<sup>4</sup>

When the world changes; IT must change with it. That means CIOs must
adapt to the realities of the post-recession economy, including the
increasing popularity of managed hosting and the
cloud.

CIO magazine says that executive recruiters are now looking for
“visionary IT leaders who can partner with the front office, are focused
on external customers, speak the language of business, and can use data
to drive revenue or uncover new business opportunities.”<sup>5</sup>

Are you ready to acknowledge the need for change and do whatever it
takes to deal with it?

### Step 2: Make sure IT is working on the right things

No IT team can do everything that everyone asks. Yet IT is still doing
many maintenance tasks that don’t add much value to the company, like
racking or patching servers. If you’re still running your own
datacenter, you know managing multiple vendor relationships eats up
hours and returns little value.

The truth is, too much IT is done for the sake of IT, not for the sake
of the business, especially the many routine chores that amount to
nothing more than “keeping the lights on.” Most executives agree: To get
better results, CIOs must focus more on strategic innovation and less on
routine maintenance.

#### Turn around your 80-20

The Pareto Principle observes that 80% of results are often generated
from only 20% of efforts. The 80-20 rules applies to many IT
departments: Many devote only a small fraction of their efforts to
strategic new projects.

“Many large organizations currently devote around 70 to 75% of their IT
budget to managing their existing infrastructure, leaving little room
for innovation that can bring value to the business,” noted one HP
executive.<sup>6</sup>

To generate real results, CIOs must use the 80-20 rule to change their
priorities; in other words, flip from 80% maintenance to 80%
innovation.

#### Strategic projects to consider

Major cost-cutting from operations helped companies survive the
recession. Now CEOs want to see imaginative plans to re-engineer
inefficient processes for ongoing savings.

According to a CIO briefing from Gartner, CEOs today want to see projects
that generate cash, create new efficiencies, avoid new taxes, and
provide long-term sustainability. More specifically, Gartner says, “the
majority of CIOs should add e-commerce, e-service, social marketing,
smartphone or location-based innovations.”

Other popular strategic projects are virtualization and business
intelligence. Every one of these projects can be achieved faster and at
lower cost through managed hosting and the cloud than through in-house
development and deployment.

Gartner goes on to suggest a radical strategy. “CIOs should target at
least one major business process to be revolutionized or obliterated in
2011 or 2012... One example would be eradicating paper statements to
customers.”<sup>7</sup>

Just because you’ve always done something doesn’t mean you always will.

### Step 3: Make sure IT is doing things the right way

The mantra “do more with less” still echoes in every boardroom. In
fact, The Standish Group estimates that the average IT team is asked to
reduce costs by 10% every year. To do this, IT has to scrutinize every
line in its budget and confirm that it’s still cost-effective.<sup>8</sup>

Fortunately, IT managers can use managed hosting and the cloud to
achieve both ends of the equation: To slim down their budgets by
outsourcing routine chores, and to get quick results from strategic new
projects. What’s more, every CFO prefers to see an operating expense for
services rather than a capital expense for hardware, which is a drag on
corporate balance sheets... so the CFO will more likely be on IT’s side
for these proposals.

Beyond the CFO, other executives hear about the cloud every day.
Line-of-business managers may go behind IT’s back to deal with SaaS
providers. End users want an experience more like Facebook and less like
some client/server application from the
1990s.

All these pressures are hard to satisfy without moving to cloud
computing or managed hosting. That doesn’t have to mean losing control.
While SaaS or cloud computing provides a quick, easy path to new apps,
over time the CIO needs to take those under his wing to manage and
integrate them properly.

#### Apps to consider hosting

“There are some things that are core to the business that you might
want to keep inside,” notes one CTO. “But there are plenty of other apps
that make sense to outsource, so you owe it to yourself as a leader to
evaluate different options.”<sup>9</sup>

You can use hosting or cloud computing in bite sized chunks; it’s not
an all-or-nothing decision. Here are some areas to consider for managed
hosting:

- External-facing apps like websites, portals, and e-commerce

- E-mail or collaboration tools that people access from different locations

- A new or upgraded app for marketing, HR or finance

If you’re running out of datacenter space, needing to expand capacity,
or launching new apps, these are ideal times to look at managed hosting.

“Organizations across the globe have cut millions of dollars from their
IT budgets by closing and consolidating data centers, reducing servers,
and centrally controlling operations,” says The Standish
Group.<sup>10</sup> Your enterprise could do the same.

#### Be prepared to redeploy your people

Most IT managers want to protect their people and preserve their jobs.
However, not everyone likes doing routine maintenance. As IT shifts to
doing more strategic projects in a more innovative way, people’s jobs
must shift accordingly.

Here are some tactics IT managers can use to retain staff:

- Shift people into new roles, such as training or project management

- “Embed” people in other departments as business analysts or IT evangelists

- Assign people to be the liasons between internal teams and new service providers

- Re-train a select few as architects

- Help proficient developers and sys admins add to desirable skills

As for anyone who resists the transition to more strategic
responsibilities, wouldn’t your team be better off without them?

“The IT department is far from dead,” said “Does IT Matter?” author
Nick Carr in a recent forum. “We’re going to see a great deal of
disruption in the IT job market over the coming years. But the good news
is that IT is becoming more, not less, important to the global economy,
and that means if you have the right set of skills you’re likely to have
rich opportunities.”<sup>11</sup>

### Conclusion

Managed hosting and the cloud are shifting IT jobs from routine
maintenance to a strategic focus on delivering value to the business.
Despite some dire predictions, executives realize that IT is a vital
element of any successful business. The real question is not how to
downsize IT, but how to improve IT strategy, performance, and ROI.
Managed hosting and the cloud can help CIOs do more with less and
contribute to the strategic success of the enterprise.
