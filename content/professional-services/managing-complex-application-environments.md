### The Value of Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> Critical Application Services
Sponsored by CITO Research

### Executive Summary

As organizations move more and more information, applications, and
interactions online to engage their customers, the performance of
external websites and internal mission critical applications has never
been more important. Innovative cloud technologies, social networking,
ubiquitous online access, and creative digital marketing campaigns are
all driving unprecedented demand on today’s IT infrastructure.
Enterprises can’t afford performance degradation or downtime, both of
which negatively impact a company’s revenue and brand. In the
unforgiving world of modern day business, as soon as performance lags,
customers begin to lose attention; organizations risk loss of customers,
reputation, and money.

Despite the critical need for high performance and uptime guarantee, in
practical terms, supporting a modern application infrastructure and
cloud environment internally on a 24/7/365 basis is difficult and
expensive, both in terms of expertise and software licensing.  A recent
offering from Rackspace, Rackspace Critical Application Services,
provides a cost-effective solution for providing uptime and performance
that makes good business sense.

Rackspace Critical Application Services offers:

-   A dedicated, experienced team of webscale
-   Proactive application/infrastructure performance monitoring
-   A best practices approach to optimizing performance and uptime
-   Backed with a 100% production platform uptime guarantee engineers

With Rackspace Critical Application Services, business leaders can
engage their customers and deliver results, freeing up IT teams to
deliver agility and innovation to service more customers.

CITO Research wrote this white paper to inform executives on how a
service approach for maintaining mission critical applications allows
companies to focus on their core business and not worry about their
underlying technology.

### Introduction

In the era of ubiquitous Internet access, end-users have higher
expectations for immediate response from websites and internal
applications. System failure is not an option for global brands, online
retailers, and SaaS providers relying on the latest technology for
engaging customers online. While system outages are devastating events,
application performance is critical. Slow application performance can
affect corporate revenues by up to 9%, according to the Aberdeen
Group.<sup>1</sup> Conversely, speeding up a website’s load time by only 3
seconds could boost revenue by 24.8%.<sup>2</sup> The pressure from increased
user demand, converging technologies, and competitors operating at
“Internet speed” is only expected to grow:

-   Online retailers braced for a 2012 holiday shop- ping season with sales
rates up 12% over 2011.<sup>3</sup>
-   The software-as-a-service (SaaS) market was expected to reach $14.5 billion
in revenue in 2012, according to Gartner Group. SaaS and cloud-based services
are expected to make up 16% of enterprise application spending in 2015, up from
11% in 2010.<sup>4</sup>
-   Salesforce App Exchange features over 220,000 applications.<sup>5</sup>

Spending on traditional enterprise applications, which have historically
comprised a majority of IT budgets, continues to rise, up 4.5% in
2012.<sup>6</sup>

Whether you are an online retailer, creating the next killer SaaS
application, or developing cloud-based internal applications to run your
business, organizations have to prepare for failures and triaging
performance issues. A Dunn & Bradstreet report determined that 59% of
Fortune 500 companies experience a minimum of 1.6 hours of downtime per
week. If the average Fortune 500 company had 10,000 employees, paid an
average of $56 per hour including benefits, the labor cost of that
downtime would be \$896,000 per week, or $46 million per year.^7^ The
statistics across the industry are staggering and additional research
helps quantify the cost of outages and poor application performance:

-   Manual configuration errors cost up to $72,000 per hour in web application
downtime.<sup>8</sup>
-   Data center downtime costs an average of $5,600 per minute.<sup>9</sup>
-   In the UK, IT downtime costs businesses more than $3.2 billion annually.<sup>10</sup>
-   Reservation management company Navitaire had to compensate Australia’s
Virgin Blue airlines about $20 million after its customer service application
collapsed, resulting in 130 canceled flights and delays for 60,000 passengers.<sup>11</sup>
-   IT downtime costs $26.5 billion annually in lost revenue in North America
and Europe combined.<sup>12</sup>

Such unacceptably high costs and revenue losses underscore the
importance of uptime and optimized performance. Business leaders should
be asking themselves:

-   What is the cost of downtime or poor application performance to my business
in dollars, reputation, and customer satisfaction?
-   Can our IT department or service provider guarantee 100% production platform
uptime?

### When “99.999” Is Not Enough

Modern application and infrastructure environments are complicated. High
performance is now harder to achieve because online websites and
internal applications are more complex than ever. Today, the average web
page is made up of about 87 individual pieces of functionality.<sup>13</sup>  It
would be difficult enough if those pieces all came from one source, but
instead, elements come from various ad networks, social media, and other
sites, even though the page is presented under the customer’s brand.

Similarly, client/server applications cannot simply be redeployed via
new cloud technologies; they must be re-architected from the ground up
to take advantage of the distributed nature and scalability of the cloud
platform. Only then can an application scale to meet the potential
demand that may occur. This complexity contributes to the performance
issues that customers and users may experience. CITO Research has found
that although performance and uptime are critical to the business,
enterprises are largely unprepared to support application performance
expectations, particularly as the cloud, social media, and mobile
applications add new layers of complexity.

### Maintaining a Modern Application Environment

Adding to this is the complexity of maintaining a modern website and
application environment. IT professionals spend a majority of their time
maintaining the status quo. Typical duties include building servers and
laptop images, installing software and hardware updates and patches,
testing and deploying configurations into the organization, and finally,
providing support.

Physically staffing an internal, dedicated, 24/7/365 application
environment is challenging given the mantra of “doing more with less.”
Simply maintaining the status quo is not a strategy for success when the
business seeks to outperform the previous quarter or year.

### Experienced, Dedicated IT Staff Are Essential for Success

Many IT departments lack the technology and resources to maintain
performance. According to the results of an IDG Research Services poll,
31% of organizations lack sufficient application monitoring and
management capabilities.

There’s a critical need for experienced staff to keep applications—and
the infrastructure running them—humming around the clock and around the
world. Through 2015, 80% of outages impacting mission-critical services
will be caused by people and process issues—not by the core technology
itself failing—and more than 50% of those people/process issues will be
related to change/configuration/release integration and hand-offs.<sup>14</sup>

The structure of corporate IT departments makes a coordinated incident
response difficult. Most IT departments are divided into specialties
that represent a given area of technology expertise—here a network
administrator, there a storage expert—and each specialty has a tool
optimized for his individual area. This means the response to an outage
or failure is often fragmented. In the event of an application failure,
a lack of coordinated effort and visibility into the entire transaction
process can cost valuable hours of recovery time. It’s one thing to say,
“Our servers have 99% reliability” and “Our network is 95% reliable”—
but when applications are comprised of dozens of components, who vouches
for the user experience, or the end-to-end operation in aggregate?

Until recently, there were very few options for the average enterprise
that sought to provide 24/7/365 support for production environments both
onsite and cloud-based. Such an effort can easily cost \$500,000 up
front, including labor.

Industry data shows that poor performance and application downtime will
impact the business; it’s only a matter of time. Business leaders have a
choice: mitigate the risk by onboarding a service offered by an
experienced provider or pay high consulting and resolution fees after an
outage.

### Critical Application Services: A Cost-Effective Alternative

Recognizing their clients’ need to support performance and uptime on
high-end production environments, Rackspace teamed with CA Technologies
to offer [Critical Application
Services](http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise_hosting/critical_applications/).
Rackspace already stakes its reputation on [Fanatical
Support®](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/)—the total
devotion of employees to ensuring an excellent customer experience, with
dedicated teams maintaining deep knowledge of their customers’
environments. Rackspace has built its entire organization around
customer support. Its most comprehensive service offering, Rackspace
Critical Application Services, provides a 100% production platform
uptime guarantee, a dedicated team of web-scale engineers with deep
knowledge and experience in the entire stack through the application
layer, and 360-degree visibility into applications and infrastructure.

### Three Pillars of Service

As Rackspace deploys high-end, enterprise-grade technology across a wide
user base and backs it up with certified, trained, and experienced
staff, the barrier to entry for uptime guarantee and performance of
critical applications is significantly reduced, particularly as
businesses launch new websites or move the critical applications into
the cloud.

The service level agreement for Rackspace Critical Application Services
is based on three pillars:

-   **100% production platform uptime guarantee.** Rackspace guarantees the
availability of approved application environments, from the application tier to
production hardware, with a 5-minute notification response.
-   **Webscale engineers.** Rackspace brings to bear the deep experience of the
engineers on the Rackspace Critical Application Services team, with years of
experience managing the world’s most demanding applications and websites. Each
customer is supported by a dedicated team of IT systems engineers. Their primary
focus is not to fix problems that have already occurred, but rather to help
prevent issues from occurring to begin with.
-   **Enhanced visibility.** The use of CA Technologies’ monitoring tools,
combined with Rackspace’s data center and engineering experience, means
enterprises can get a 360-degree view of their entire application and
infrastructure environment, from the user interface to the switches and routers
underneath it all.

The technology Rackspace is using is also a key differentiator. Very few
enterprises have CA Technologies’ ability to offer both network-aware
application management and application-aware network management—the
complete picture of quality of service and experience. Deployed in ten
of the largest banks in the US, CA Technologies is known for its
patented, model-based root cause analysis, which contains more than
10,000 predefined issue models. Both of these vendors are Gartner Magic
Quadrant leaders.

### Let Internal IT Focus on Top-Line Business Initiatives

Rackspace works with your internal IT team, effectively complementing
their efforts. The Rackspace team devotes itself to learning about and
managing critical application infrastructure and providing
high-availability hosting and monitoring services. The team is
constantly learning about and deploying patches, upgrades, and solutions
as well as installing the latest platform-enhancing technologies. Their
singular devotion to application performance and uptime means internal
IT teams can be relieved of routine activities such as maintaining
infrastructure to support applications, freeing IT staff to focus on
high value projects for your particular business.

At many companies, IT staff spend 80% of their time and budget on simply
maintaining the status quo and only 20% working on developing solutions
that add value to the bottom line.^15^ Using Critical Application
Services inverts this scenario—when IT staff spend 80% of their time
working on projects that advance business value, that’s 80% of an IT
investment supporting top-line business initiatives.

Rackspace’s experience has developed exponentially over the company’s
brief history. They have been servicing customers since 1998 and have
developed best practices for efficiently managing multiple environments
for over 200,000 customers. The average IT department has experience
with their own environment and perhaps a few others. Rackspace’s
Critical Application Services team complements internal IT teams,
letting customers leverage the combination of support, expertise, and
in-depth visibility to maintain critical applications.

Given that digital campaigns, SaaS, and the cloud are relatively new
territory for many customers, an additional level of assurance comes
from Rackspace Critical Application Services’ ability to monitor the
network for potential bottlenecks and other issues and to proactively
notify the customer up to several weeks in advance of potential issues.
The teams can often collaborate with customers to develop a solution
before a problem emerges.

### Improve the TCO of Supporting High-Performance Apps

Before the Rackspace Critical Application Services is set up, the
support team works with enterprise IT staff and the business user base
to establish uptime goals, system profiles, and support needs. This
includes identifying the most critical applications, infrastructure
components, monitoring criteria, and resolution and escalation paths.
All of these criteria are documented and entered in advance of
deployment in an IT runbook.

Rackspace Critical Application Services is available for an affordable
monthly cost, which is booked as an operating expense versus a capital
expense, and can be implemented in a matter of weeks, versus an in-house
approach that could cost upwards of \$500,000, take six months or longer
to implement, and potentially has more risk associated with it. For
those customers who will be duplicating servers for the first time,
costs may be somewhat higher, but the appeal of 100% uptime and high
performance will help determine whether that investment is worthwhile.
In short, Rackspace hosted offering provides 100% production platform
uptime, webscale engineering expertise, and end-to-end visibility for
less than the cost of one full-time engineer.

### Conclusion

In the brave new world of online applications, business users and
consumers expect instant gratification. If applications appear sluggish,
the business suffers. Online retailers want to limit revenue impact from
slow response times. Software-as-a-Service vendors want to maintain
customer satisfaction. Digital campaigns are often time-critical and
impact the brand. Custom applications can’t “fall down” under traffic
spikes. All of these are critical applications, in need of a high level
of service that many companies struggle to provide cost-effectively.

Rackspace and CA Technologies have teamed up to deliver a solution that
offers 100% production platform and network uptime guarantees, dedicated
webscale engineering staff, and comprehensive, end-to-end visibility
into the entire application and infrastructure stack. By combining a
high level of customer support and expertise with best-in-class
technology that is normally out of reach for all but the largest
enterprises, Rackspace has amortized the cost of this critical service,
allowing business leaders to focus on their customers and not worrying
about their infrastructure.
