### Introduction

At Rackspace, we are committed to imbuing our core values into the
entire range of experiences around our products and services. In
providing customers with exceptional customer service, branded Fanatical
Support®, we take into consideration a much broader range of issues than
the typical software design principle of user experience. We design the
experience for a complete ecosystem of people who interact with our
products, and importantly, with each other. The experience a developer,
DevOps engineer, support technician, operations manager, or any other
Rackspace employee has is just as important as the customer’s
experience, because ultimately, it helps make the customer’s experience
even better. Our systems need to be user-friendly for everyone. We’re
enthusiastic about the design of our products and services, and we work
diligently to make sure they work as a coherent whole. We have embarked
on a journey to instill our core values into every aspect of the
Rackspace experience, inside and out. To achieve this, Rackspace uses a
discipline called experience design.

### What Is Experience Design?

Experience design helps designers not only create the right products,
but also design them right. Designers use a broad set of information so
that they can create something that has a better chance of making users
happy. That information incorporates roles, people, and usage
categories, not only in terms of the user experience, but also across
systems, services, and interactions. It accounts for all the various
stakeholders and constituents and their experiences, no matter how they
come into contact with a product or service. Unlike other design
disciplines, experience design does not try to eliminate the virtuosity
of a unique asset or person because these touches may be what make a
product or service truly excellent.

Experience design is synthesized from many time-tested design practices,
ranging from user-centered design to the architectural principles of
wayfinding. Experience design evolved from traditional principles of
human-computer interaction, as well as business process and service
design. It examines the ways people come into contact with processes,
services, and interfaces, whether physical or virtual, with the goal of
creating products and services of high utility.

### Experience Design Is Not (Just) User Experience

It is tempting to confuse experience design with user experience (UX), a
significant quality factor in software design. But user experience is
one small part of experience design. UX focuses on the user’s
interaction with software. Experience design is about interaction
coherency—not just consistency—across the experience of a product or
service, regardless of who’s interacting with it. That includes
developers, support staff, executives, operations staff, and, of course,
users.

We have incorporated experience design into our own practices to drive
our core values into everything we produce.

### Rackspace Core Values

To become the service leader in cloud computing, Rackspace operates
around the following core values:

**Fanatical Support in All We Do**
We strive to create software, systems, and interaction models that echo
the exceptional customer service ethos and empower our customers by
providing the information they need to accomplish their tasks and
objectives—producing outcomes that matter.

**Results First: Substance over Flash**
Rackers (Rackspace employees) would rather see smooth functioning code
that gets the job done efficiently than a flashy user interface. If you
need to move a filesystem into the cloud, code that makes it fast and
easy is more important than a pretty, but less efficient, interface.

**Committed to Greatness**
The Rackspace design process addresses each key moment as a
value-for-value exchange. While few people can describe what’s
distinctive about the Rackspace experience, the design team looks at key
experience moments to make sure what’s special about Rackspace surfaces
through every interaction.

**Full Disclosure and Transparency**
We work big and we work visual. The early part of the design process
involves exposing our thinking to get early feedback. From there,
creating a minimally working version lets us get insights and supports
the core value of full disclosure and transparency. Rather than waiting
for something to be perfect, the sooner we internally circulate a
working version for feedback, the more transparency we get into the
development process.

**Passion for Our Work**
The result of user research and usability testing is information, not
quality. When we get feedback in the form of suggestions, complaints,
questions, or confusion, we assume positive intent and take it to heart.
What we do with that information results in quality.

**Treat Fellow Rackers Like Friends and Family**
Building awesome products for our customers is simply not enough. The
experience our customers have with our products is only part of the
relationship our customers have with Rackspace. As a result, we see the
customer-facing part of the design process as only half of the equation.
Focusing how to deliver value-for-value exchanges means that we design
employee-facing systems that perform well.

### Why Did Rackspace Deploy Experience Design?

Rackspace’s purpose is to make cloud computing simple for business.
Experience design was introduced so that the Rackspace experience would
incorporate the company’s core values into the product development
process as deeply as possible.

Rackspace has historically been a managed hosting company that provided
a secure, offsite location for companies to run hardware and software.
The experience of running these assets offsite didn’t have to be
substantially different from doing so in one’s own facilities. We could
design familiar interfaces because customers were used to managing their
infrastructure, and the relationship between the physical hardware,
operating systems, and applications.

Once Rackspace began offering cloud-computing services, we recognized
that the experience would need to be different. Because, with the cloud,
the architecture is different. And there is less of a direct correlation
between the dedicated computing configurations a customer historically
needed and the kind of cloud infrastructure required to solve the same
kinds of business problems. Cloud products, by their nature, are
abstracted away from all of their constituent parts. Now we’re building
products on top of a cloud-computing platform that requires its own way
of thinking and relies on different assumptions. Yet the products need
to be familiar and intuitive so that people can understand them and
derive a high level of utility from them.

Rackspace has built a new service organization to create new products on
top of a cloud-computing platform. While this includes new assumptions
about product design, one fundamental assumption won’t change: business
is people, and technology is here to serve people. That’s why Rackspace
has an experience designer to build and lead the Experience Design
organization and to create and develop products that are both useful and
useable—for everyone who touches them.

### Experience Design In Action At Rackspace

Fundamentally, we believe that:

-   It’s not good enough to just design great products. Products need to reflect
the values embodied by our employees—simple and intuitive.
-   User interfaces (not just technology, but all touch points) need to be
consistent with the Rackspace brand. This is about fundamental experiences, not
just appearance. Before we worry too much about look and feel, we must consider
whether we’re designing the right product and how well it is designed.
-   Interactions with employees and the product need to be part of a coherent
experience. In other words, the interactions themselves need to be perceived as
supportive.
-   When we design systems, we must think of them not just as pieces of software,
but also as a whole chain of cause and effect moments that makes up an experience,
which can include user, employee, and electronic (automated) actions.

Each of our Core Values is embodied in one or more mottos. Here are a
few examples.

**"Documentation Is Defect"**

Fundamentally, we believe design should be intuitive. That’s why, when a
developer designs a product feature that needs documentation to explain
how it works, we consider that a defect, and we send them back to the
drawing board with a specification for a redesign. We aim to create user
interfaces so intuitive that they don’t need documentation. If and when
we document, we want it to answer questions, add insight, and deliver
real value to an audience such as software developers, who need
information that goes beyond what the user interface can deliver.

**“Nothing is a No-Brainer”**

Just because we’re designing an intuitive experience, that doesn’t mean
we operate on gut instinct to put our ideas in motion. Quite the
opposite. “Nothing is a no-brainer” means every stage of design receives
a thorough review. We look for patterns, and once we find them, we can
codify some methodologies. This still leaves room for creativity,
problem solving, and unique design solutions.

**“Coherence Over Consistency” – When Core Values Conflict**

Consistency cannot interfere with high-utility design and value
delivery. It’s far more important that the experience be coherent than
consistent. Designing the right thing, and designing it right, means
that sometimes a product needs to be different to deliver the highest
value. In those cases, we let it be different.

For example, Rackspace recently set out to create a consolidated
knowledge base for the support team. We discovered that four of the five
preexisting knowledge bases had similar architectures, but the fifth,
aimed at email and applications support, was anomalous. Its search
capability, and relevance ranking differed significantly from its peers,
and much of its value would have been lost if it were folded into the
macro-architecture.

In defense of coherence, we halted shipment of the unified knowledge
base, instead shipping the four similar knowledge bases together as
planned, alongside the fifth product, which retained its architecture.
We added a feedback channel into all the knowledge bases so that
customers could tell us what was working.

Experience design was applied in this situation because the defensible
motivation of passion in all we do was potentially conflicting with the
core promise. It wouldn’t be right, in the name of consistency, to
release a product that was a step backward in terms of finding
information to solve mission-critical problems.

The story has a happy ending. In the next release, the unified knowledge
base incorporated the superior information architecture, interaction
model, and functionality of the fifth knowledge base across all of the
others.

### Customer Feedback and Experience Design

Rackspace collects an enormous amount of customer feedback in order to
provide the best possible experience.

For quantitative, and high-level anecdotal data, Rackspace makes extensive
use of the Net Promoter<sup>&reg;</sup> Score to calibrate the experience.
Net Promoter works best as a trailing indicator of customer satisfaction
for features and is not as effective as a leading indicator, so we don’t
use it as a predictive model. However, its ability to communicate direct
customer anecdotes and comments to the team is highly developed.

In the near future, we will be adding in a higher-fidelity model that
follows a real-time closed-loop feedback model, which will collect
unstructured data and better help bring the voice of the customer
directly into the design and development process.

For example, we’re currently redesigning our control panel, with faster
OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup>-based APIs that will allow shorter turnaround times for
adding and deleting servers, or resizing storage capacity. However, we
realize that even if the APIs are faster, it doesn’t matter unless the
customer perceives them as faster. Creating that perception requires a
more holistic take on design than simply upgrading the underlying
technology.

### Design Tools to Support Execution Flexibility

Rackspace has instituted a set of design tools to help align the various
parts of the company involved in product design, yet we leave room for
flexibility when it comes to executing the designs. These design tools
include:

-   **Desired Outcomes:** A thinking framework that creates a compelling
description of the target design in a way that makes the concept easily
digestible and understandable for product managers, engineers, and designers,
without the need for a prototype.
-   **Mental Models:** Mental models are visual maps of how a person thinks.
They showcase the gaps between how people think about what they want to
accomplish and what the designs actually support. At Rackspace, we have an
Indi-Young-style mental model 40 feet long and 4 feet high of our latest control
panel design.
-   **Experience Moments:** Experience moments map a desired outcome against a
sequence series of points in time. It’s a technique for “threading the needle”
of requirements that will meet or exceed the user’s expectations, that is, the
sum of their needs and wants in a given context.
-   **Behavioral Personas:** Behavioral personas create representative users,
based not on their demographics and attitudes, but on their goals, objectives,
and actual task-based behaviors. They embody behaviors that are common across a
segment of the system. Behaviors can refer to actions undertaken by people or
computer systems.

### Driving Organizational Development

We’re big believers in empathy at Rackspace. Our version of the Golden
Rule is “Treat fellow Rackers like friends and family.” We believe that
the only way to offer excellent customer experiences is to make sure our
own employees are having a great experience. We also believe in the old
adage of “walking a mile in another man’s shoes.” Those beliefs apply to
several key aspects of experience design and find their way into our
practices, such as:

-   **Embedding Practitioners in Business Units:** Experience designers need to
be in the field with their product lines. This makes them the best
representatives for the needs of a product and the design of the product for use
in different customer segments. At Rackspace, each product line has a design
leader. This person is a single point of contact and helps the product line be
successful from an experience design point of view, encouraging thinking about
the system holistically.
-   **Assuming Positive Intent:** Designing great products and providing
exceptional customer support isn’t always easy. Humans are vulnerable to
misunderstandings. We employ the maxim “assume positive intent.” In other words,
Rackers assume that whomever they are interacting with had the best intentions,
but may not have had all the information they needed. This promotes respect and
productivity.
-   **Hiring customers to get their view:** Sometimes our customers have such
great, detailed ideas, we listen to them. They really bring the customer
perspective.
-   **Optimizing the Racker® Software Experience:** We apply experience design
to every aspect of the Racker experience. We ask questions, such as “who is
affected by an interface or a process, and how?” We take the same care we do when
designing customer interfaces, streamlining the number of steps to do a task.
-   **Giving Priority to the Racker Point of View:** We don’t let executive
priorities override the employees’ perception when making design choices about
products they will use. We recently launched a pilot to study employee
experiences and perceptions when interacting with the products.

### Crafting the User Experience

We believe that how you say it is just as important as what you say.
That’s why we are always working to improve our dialogue with users, no
matter how they encounter us—in person, over the phone or through an
electronic interface with one of our products.

-   **Voicing:** Rackspace does a good deal of modeling to achieve consistency
in the language we use, both in electronic and human interfaces, which we call
 voicing. The goal is not to be robotic, but respectful of context and respond
 in a way consistent with the brand.
-   **Word choice, tone, and clarity are all important.** When we’re trying to
help, we try to distinguish when it is best to ask questions and when to give
directions. When things break, neither computer nor human should make rude
comments.
-   **Diagramming:** Currently Rackspace is diagramming all its error and
informational messages to improve them, striking a balance between informative
and informal.

### Conclusion

At Rackspace, we introduced Experience Design to support a design
philosophy that is comprehensive and coherent, and which pervades our
efforts to provide the best possible experience for everyone who builds
and uses our products and services, whether they’re prospects,
customers, developers, or Rackers.

The cloud has unleashed a new, more abstract paradigm in the way that
people interact with computer hardware and software, and it demands a
responsive collection of products that reflect that reality. But even as
computing becomes more abstract, the concrete human values of
transparency, respect, and empathy are more important than ever to our
mission. When our employees and customers tangibly perceive our core
values in every interaction they have with Rackspace, we take that as
evidence that this experiment is working.
