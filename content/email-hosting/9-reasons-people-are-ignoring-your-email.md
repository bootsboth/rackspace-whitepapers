Google “email mistakes”, and you’ll find endless resources. But they all
say the same thing:

-   Include a first name in the email.
-   Avoid using business jargon.
-   Don’t forget to include a greeting.
-   Don’t say “to whom it may concern.”
-   Make sure you change the subject line.
-   Spellcheck your work.
-   Avoid emoticons.

And the list goes on. But all of these suggestions are common sense
suggestions for beginner email users. If you’re a business professional
today, what are the mistakes you’re not seeing, that aren’t obvious, and
are preventing your emails from reciprocating a response?

That’s what this guide is about. We’ll review actual best practices your
emails should follow for business success. Feel free to skim through, or
use the table of contents to navigate to the mistakes you think you’re
making.

### MISTAKE 1: YOUR SUBJECT LINE FOCUSES ON THE WRONG GOAL

It’s no secret that an effective subject line is needed to ultimately
get an email opened. But when writing these subject lines, think about
your true end goal.

The goal of any email you send should simply be about getting a
response. It shouldn’t be about closing a deal, finalizing a
partnership, or hiring a candidate. Until you can get a response on your
email, until you can truly connect with your recipient, you’re nowhere
closer to your goal.

Here are some example subject lines we’ve seen work:

-   {First Name}, quick question for you.
-   {Mutual connection} recommended I get in touch. Ideas for {what’s important
to them}.
-   Question about {recent trigger event}.
-   Question about {a goal they have}.
-   Thoughts about {title of their blog post}.
-   Have you considered {thought/recommendation}?

### MISTAKE 2: YOU’RE SENDING ALL YOUR EMAIL AT THE WRONG TIME

Most business emails are sent during business hours. But recent data
from the 2014 Email Open Rates Report shows something slightly
surprising.

<img src="{% asset_path email-hosting/9-reasons-people-are-ignoring-your-email/RS-HS-1.png %}" width="491" height="459" />

The gray line shows the number of emails sent each day of
the week. This line illustrates that most emails were sent on Monday,
with over 1,000,000 sent that day. The least amount of emails were sent
on Saturday and Sunday, of course, with under 200,000 sent on each of
those days.

The black line shows the open rate of the emails for each day of the
week. The worst days for open rates are Monday and Tuesday. However, the
open rate gradually increases over the course of the week and then
spikes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now we’re not saying that you should alter your strategy to send all
emails on the weekend, but there should be some strategic balance. If
you really want to capture the attention of someone important that isn’t
getting back to you, try a Sunday night email. Otherwise, stick to your
business hours.

### MISTAKE 3: USING A GENERIC SENDER ADDRESS

While many one-to-one emails come from an individual account, you may
need to send to a larger group if want to update vendors about an
important policy or process change, or you work in support and need to
contact customers regarding a new feature update that fixed many product
bugs.

<img src="{% asset_path email-hosting/9-reasons-people-are-ignoring-your-email/RS-HS-2.png %}" width="505" height="386" />

Whichever the case, the name you include in the “From” field of your
email can have a huge impact on your overall open rates. There’s been a
number of studies that show sending emails from an actual person
increases both the open and clickthrough rates.

As you can see in the graph, the control generated a 0.73% clickthrough
rate (CTR), and the treatment generated a 0.96% CTR. With a confidence
of 99.9%, there was a clear winner.

And it makes sense – customers and contacts feel a more personal
connection to your email when they receive it from “Maggie Georgieva”
than they do from Company X, or worse, some version of “donotreply.com.”

### MISTAKE 4: “PERSONALIZING” WITHOUT ACTUALLY PERSONALIZING

When we say personalization, we don’t mean replacing “Hi there” with “Hi
Amanda.” Our email recipient’s smart enough to know that with the click
of a magic digital button, our emails can be personalized with first
name, company name, and so on.

<img src="{% asset_path email-hosting/9-reasons-people-are-ignoring-your-email/RS-HS-3.png %}" width="579" height="441" />

This email is personalized in a few ways:

1.  Relevance: Not only does it include the first name, it opens with a custom
event in the recipient’s life.
2.  Connect: Connects the recipient’s expertise with your own as the sender.
3.  Next Step: Provides a specific timeframe to chat.
4.  Personalizing in today’s business environment involves taking the time to
learn about the individual you’re contacting. Let’s look at an example:

### MISTAKE 5: SENDING SELFISH “JUST CHECKING-IN” EMAIL

We’ve all hit a stage in our business where we just really need a
response. There’s an open job you’re trying to fill and the perfect
candidate has yet to respond to you. There’s a golden partnership
opportunity to help your brand but the partner just isn’t getting back
to you.

In these desperate times, many resort to sending emails like the
following:

<img src="{% asset_path email-hosting/9-reasons-people-are-ignoring-your-email/RS-HS-4.png %}" width="500" height="390" />

This email displays worst practices you need to completely avoid:

1.  Using a generic opening with no personalization to your relationship with
the prospect.
2.  You admit you’re checking-in for the sake of checking-in, and have no real
value add.
3.  You’re asking the prospect for information rather than giving them
information.
4.  You end with a generic call- to-action, rather than giving a specific next
step

### MISTAKE 6: FORGETTING ABOUT MOBILE USERS

Many people still write emails with only a desktop-view in mind. If you
receive a six-paragraph email, how excited are you to read it? Now
imagine getting that same email on mobile.

<img src="{% asset_path email-hosting/9-reasons-people-are-ignoring-your-email/RS-HS-5.png %}" width="502" height="238" />

It’s easy to forget that mobile devices need to be top-of- mind, so here
are some stats to make it stick:

-   74 % of smartphone owners use their devices to check their email.
([Source: Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2070515))
-   81% of tablet owners use their devices to check emails.
([Source: Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2070515))
-   68% of Gmail and Yahoo! users’ opens occur on a smartphone or tablet.
([Source: Litmus](https://litmus.com/blog/mobile-opens-hit-51-percent-android-claims-number-3-spot))
-   More email is read on mobile than on a desktop email client.
([Source: Litmus](https://litmus.com/blog/mobile-opens-hit-51-percent-android-claims-number-3-spot))

With that in mind, we recommend keeping your emails to 3 to 6 sentences,
not 3 to 6 paragraphs.

### MISTAKE 7: ENDING THE EMAIL WITHOUT AN EASY NEXT STEP

You already know your email should have an end goal in mind, but you
also need to ensure your email ends with that end goal in mind for your
reader.

Whether it’s downloading a piece of content, scheduling a time to
connect, or sharing information for a job opening, every goal needs to
be stated strategically with its respect next step.

Let’s say the goal is to find a time to connect. Many best practices
suggest finding an open spot on your calendar, and recommending a few.
This may look like: “Are you free to chat at 10 AM, 2PM or 5PM Monday or
Tuesday?”

But here’s the problem with this – what if the recipient isn’t available
at those times? Should we expect them to find an open time? Or do we
think they’ll get too busy with their work and just ignore your email
for now?

Remember, the main goal of this email is to get a response – make it
easy by saying something like: “Would you be willing to chat for ten
minutes next week?”

This accomplishes the following:

1.  It makes it super easy to get a response – it’s either yes or no.
2.  A light ask for “ten minutes” shows you’re not demanding too much.
3.  There’s a clear response the recipient has to give to show interest in
engaging with you.

### MISTAKE 8: USING A SIGNATURE THAT DISTRACTS FROM YOUR GOAL

Many professionals get too caught up in their email signatures. They
begin including quotes, large images, multiple URLs, and so on.

But the point of your signature is to provide beneficial contact
information. It’s that simple. Just like too much activity on a landing
page can distract a user from the main call-to-action for that page, a
heavy signature can distract a reader from the main goal of getting your
email read.

To keep your email signatures from being a distraction, we recommend:

-   Keeping them short – there shouldn’t be a need to scroll up, down, left, or
right.
-   Using plain, black and white text.
-   Providing contact information and a link to view your online profile of
choice (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).

### MISTAKE 9: SENDING ANOTHER EMAIL WHEN YOU DON’T GET A QUICK RESPONSE

It’s easy to find yourself clicking refresh repeatedly in your inbox
after sending an important email. After a day of seeing no response
back, you jump to the refresh game again the next day. But that day of
impatience leads you to send another email.

We need to be smarter than that.

Rather than constantly looking for a response to your email, constantly
look to see if your email has even been interacted with. Has the email
been opened? Has the link in your email been clicked?

Just because someone hasn’t responded to your email, doesn’t mean
they’re not actively engaging with it. And if they are engaging, we need
to give them the time they need to respond on their own – while having
the satisfaction that they’ve seen it.

Fortunately there’s technology that gives you access to such information
– Signals is a free tool that we recommend. With Signals, you don’t have
to keep sending emails when you don’t get a response. You only have to
send them when you see that an email has not been opened and actually
needs an extra nudge.

### CONCLUSION: A HOW-TO TEMPLATE TO HELP YOU SEND EFFECTIVE EMAIL
