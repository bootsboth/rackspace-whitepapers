### Uncovering The Negative Impacts On Brand Perception, Productivity, and Performance

In today’s hyper-connected world, email is a vital platform for small
businesses to build relationships with customers and prospects, support
internal employee communication, and optimize overall productivity.

Email remains the linchpin of all communication channels. In fact,
findings from Forrester Research reveal that 87% of all company
communications are via email<sup>1</sup>. Businesses also are amping up
performance and productivity via mobile tools and technologies,
including smartphones and tablet devices, while team members are on the
go.

The benefits of [mobile
email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/on_your_mobile/)
are especially strong for small businesses that are striving to build their
employee and customer bases, and require instant connectivity, anytime
and anywhere.

Initially, free email platforms seem like the ideal solution for a small
business establishing itself in the marketplace: They’re free, easy to
register, and have basic, easy-to-operate functionality. However, as
organizations expand, they often realize there are substantial costs and
risks associated with free services, especially within the three key
areas of a successful enterprise:

-   Perception, or how prospects and current customers view a company and its
overall brand;
-   Productivity and employees’ overall ability to achieve day-to-day tasks, as
well as long-term projects; and
-   Performance on both short-term and long-term goals within an organization.

Although the immediate benefits of signing up for these platforms are
attractive at first glance, limited features and security can be costly
to the overall performance of a small business.

With the average email user sending and receiving more than 40,000
messages per year, according to The Radicati Group<sup>2</sup>, an efficient
email platform is a vital asset and a mission-critical function to
business success. Not only is the communication channel required for
improving productivity among company team members, email also is now the
primary channel that sales teams utilize to reach customers and
prospects.

To effectively build perception and reputation among peers and
customers, best-in-class organizations are looking beyond the short-term
attraction of free email services, and are [leveraging hosted email
services](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/infographic-email-hosting-puts-businesses-on-the-road-to-competitive-advantage/),
which provide an array of business-savvy features, such as calendar and
contact sharing, mobile email capabilities, and cloud-based storage.

This white paper spotlights the costs and tradeoffs small businesses
must consider when selecting an email platform for their companies, as
well as the necessary tools and technologies to optimize perception,
productivity and performance among employees.

### Building Your Business: Perception Is Key

Organizations are constantly fighting for customer eyes and dollars.
This is especially true via email, where inboxes are flooded with
company communications, potential business deals, and memos.

Findings from technology market research firm the Radicati Group, in the
report, Email Statistics Report, 2011-2015, indicated that email account
holders send and receive approximately 110 emails a day. This estimate
is expected to reach 125 daily messages by the end of this year.

“[Small businesses] have to view email as an essential tool to
building and maintaining relationships with customers, as well as
continuing relationships with vendors and partners,” said Kirk Averett,
the Director of Product for Cloud Office at Rackspace. “Email’s
flexibility allows organizations to keep those relationships working.
Although there are other tools, email is the most powerful and commonly
used tool out there.”

Utilizing a company-specific domain name allows an organization to be
recognized quickly and remain top-of- mind among prospects and clients.
For example, if Joe Smith is the CEO of smartphone application developer
ViaMobile, he will tout a JoeSmith@ViaMobile.com email address, rather
than JoeSmith@gmail.com. By connecting the dots between brand name and
email address, small businesses will build awareness, recognition, and
most importantly, trust, protecting a company’s overall image as an
organization that is professional and eager to do business.

Since businesses are now connecting and engaging with their customers
and prospects primarily via the web, an email address often is the
primary reflection of a brand. The lack of a dedicated domain name
negatively reflects an organization, as well as employees’
professionalism. In fact, 75% of people form judgments about others
based on their email address, according to 1&1 Mail and Media.<sup>3</sup>
These findings are even more problematic for small businesses that are
constantly vying for customer and prospect attention in the competitive
business world.

Small and growing businesses also run the risk of seeming less
professional or may be taken less seriously if their email doesn’t have
a dedicated domain name. Organizations also may not be able to access
business-imperative information, such as research studies and webinars,
since many outlets prohibit content downloading with a general domain
name.

Overall, a consumer-level domain name raises a figurative red flag, and
encourages prospects to delete communications, avoid opening messages,
and even report messages as spam. This lack of trust can greatly hinder
a small business’ growth, relationship-building, and overall reputation.

### Solving The Spam Puzzle

Regardless of organization or position in a company, employees and
executives are faced with the challenge of sifting through email
messages and removing spam and unwanted contacts. In fact, spam
management is a leading hurdle in team members’ overall productivity and
performance, and in turn, a business’ overall success.

In fact, small business employees spend approximately 29 minutes per day
dealing with spam, according to the 2011 Report on UC and Cloud-based
Services for SMBs, conducted by Webtorials. Regardless of the obvious
detriments of spending quality business time sorting through messages,
spam management is a constant struggle among small businesses that don’t
have the solutions or resources to address these issues efficiently.

Small businesses also must determine the potential impact of not having
dedicated domain names for employees. By touting a free email address,
team members can be mistaken for spam and, in turn, add to prospect and
client frustrations.

Large Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and some web-based email
services are utilizing email authentication as an added strategy to
fight spam invasion. These stronger spam filters make it more difficult
for companies to get emails delivered and opened if they don’t have a
business-specific domain name.

Executives must acknowledge the business-wide benefits of leveraging
dedicated domain names. By touting a business-branded domain name,
organizations can make their communication goals clear, thus, increasing
the likelihood that messages will be opened and — most importantly —
read.

### Case In Point: West Arete Computing Improves Spam Management With Rackspace

A personalized email address allows businesses to reduce their own spam
intake, and in turn, improve efficiencies and overall time management.
By implementing an email hosting solution, companies can utilize
anti-virus scanners, which are typically integrated into a host’s SMTP
gateways.

[West Arete
Computing](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/customers/view/rackspace_frees_west_arete_computing_from_email_burdens/),
a custom software development firm, relied on email to receive critical
systems alerts. Although the company had an on-staff systems
administrator to run email on-premises, spam was becoming a more
time-consuming task to tackle.

“Keeping up with email and spam was a big problem,” said Scott Woods,
President and Founder of West Arete Computing. “In order to focus on
software development, we didn’t want to spend time on that.” After
trying out multiple solutions, and conducting in-depth research on
possible platforms, the company selected Rackspace.

“None did as good a job as Rackspace for experience and [spam
detection](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/spam_filtering/),”
Woods said. “I looked around online forums to see what people I knew and
trusted were saying. The consistent theme was Rackspace has good service
and a good email product.”

Hosted email solutions consistently apply the latest anti-spam updates
to shield staff from hindering productivity and draining valuable
company time. For example, Rackspace leverages a three-pronged approach
to help ensure deliverables are spam free: a Gateway Scan, a Cloudmark
Scan, and a Message Sniffer Scan. This strategy allows the company
to [block an average of 45 million spam messages a
day](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/email_spam_facts/).

### Productivity In The Work Place: Do You Have The Right Tools?

The majority of businesses (87%) tap into email as a collaboration tool
to share announcements, content and vital information, according to
Forrester Research. As a result, the “short and to the point”
communication once synonymous with email is being transformed to include
lengthy messages and larger attachments, leading to longer wait times
for email retrieval and message uploads.

When standard POP email servers are overwhelmed and systems go down,
productivity for a small business is depleted. However, this is a
constant problem among small and mid-sized businesses. In fact, company
email systems experience a mean of 53 minutes of unplanned downtime
within a month’s time, according to a recent Osterman Research<sup>4</sup>.
Hosted email solutions, however, typically guarantee 99.9% uptime,
leading to improved productivity and more efficient connectivity.

If and when email operations are up, it takes the right tools to ensure
success. Collaborative features, such as the ability to share contacts,
calendars, to-do lists and files, as well as efficient archiving
capabilities, are imperative to keep executives and employees on the
same page regarding schedules, company developments, and content
creation.

Companies that don’t provide seamless access to information and
resources across technology platforms can take a serious hit on not only
productivity, but profitability, as well. Research from IDC reveals that
inconsistent access tools, ineffective searches for updates and content
can cost a company $3,300 per employee, per year. Meaning, a small
business with 400 employees can experience a $1.32 million productivity
loss in one year alone.

The ability to share calendars, contacts and tasks is a must in the
highly connected business world. Employees and executives are constantly
traveling and more on-the-go than ever. As a result, instant access to
email accounts, mailboxes, important events, and other information is a
necessity, rather than a luxury.

“Basic capabilities such as scheduling an appointment, receiving a
reminder, tracking work, scheduling and coordinating work, and saving
history of your tasks is what makes email special and will keep it
special for a long time,” Averett said. “A lot of the new social tools
add special value, but email is still the heart of written
communications. It’s the most widespread in terms of number of users,
and has the ability to connect with friends, relatives, strangers,
customers, vendors and more; has been tested and is fully mature; and
operates at an extremely high scale. You can’t underestimate the
importance of that ability to reach anyone at anytime.”

Organizations are opting to implement hosting platforms to provide
employees and executives with instant access to emails, calendars and
contacts via mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, which
are becoming ubiquitous in the business world. The limited features of
some [POP and IMAP email
systems](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace_business_productivity_rx_pop_or_imap/)
allow no room for this form of flexibility and instant communication, which is
now required for today’s small businesses, especially as more
organizations use mobile email, tablets, laptops, and other wireless
tools as an integral part of their communication.

### The Mobile Imperative: Increased Connectivity Makes Seamless Collaboration A Necessity

Smartphone subscription and usage is growing at an unprecedented pace,
making [mobile
email](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/on_your_mobile/) a
practical and even necessary resource for on-the-go workers. In fact, an
April 2011 study sponsored by Google showed that 82% of smartphone users
check and send email with their devices<sup>5</sup>. This hyper-connected
behavior even extends into after-work hours, according to Osterman
Research. In its third annual research survey, Osterman revealed that a
vast majority of workers (83%) check email using a smartphone or mobile
device before and after a standard workday<sup>6</sup>.

“A lot of small business owners are their own best salesperson, so when
they’re out traveling, meeting with clients and prospects, they can
still be connected to all their other customers without being confined
to a desk,” Averett said. “That form of flexibility matters more and
more since we’re in a very dynamic business market. People need the
freedom to move about and travel, and even have that flexibility in
time. Long gone are the days when work was nine-to-five, and I think
[small businesses] appreciate that. So being able to roll out of bed
in the morning, answer a few emails and then get ready for the day,
being flexible, and spreading work out, is imperative to small
businesses”

Optimal [email
hosting](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/) platforms allow
data to be synced automatically or when requested by users via
BlackBerry, iPhone and Android, as well as from any laptop, desktop, or
tablet device. Push service and real-time sync is provided for all
account features, including basic mail and folders, contacts, calendars
and tasks. Leading small businesses are taking note of the companywide
benefits of implementation, including streamlined communication and task
management, as well as instant access to calendar invitations across
devices.

### Case In Point: PROACT Improves Connectivity With Hosted Email

[PROACT
Search,](http://www.rackspace.com/apps/customers/view/proact_steps_up_to_professional_email_with_rackspace/) an
educational recruiting firm, initially utilized a standard POP email
system, which provided no additional support for mobile devices. “This
POP email was not conducive to running a mid-sized company,” said Thomas
Vranas, President of PROACT Search, a Rackspace client. “Things I’d
taken for granted in the corporate world, like calendars, sharing and
invitations, are necessities.” With 80% to 90% of his company’s business
done via email, stagnant communications and delayed replies were not an
option, Vranas added. After adopting Rackspace, employees are now able
to check email from hotel computers, laptops and mobile phones, so
they’re always connected, even while on the road.

### Support 24x7x365: A Must-Have For Small Business Performance

In the business world, productivity and performance go hand-in-hand.
Daily operations are dominated by strict deadlines, new deals and
partnerships, and customer care, all of which require immediate
attention. Free email services create a greater chance of system
downtime and, in turn, lackluster performance.

“About half of our email volume comes from system status information,”
said Woods. “Email is the primary notification vehicle for system alerts
— without it, systems could go down and we’d never know.”

Overall, email platforms such as Gmail and Yahoo! require excess
maintenance, which small business owners and their IT teams simply don’t
have the time for. Moreover, by partnering with a domain name provider
such as GoDaddy, organizations are faced with sub-par knowledge of email
functionality and resources.

Companies that employ hosted email platforms, however, optimize time
management and financial resources. In fact, more than 60% of
organizations are transitioning to hosted solutions due to lower total
cost of ownership, seamless deployments and overall easier management
than network-based providers, according to Forrester Research.

[KarmaCRM](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/rackspace-managed-operations-lets-karmacrm-stay-focused-on-its-business/),
a provider of SaaS customer relationship management tools, is a startup
company that taps into [Rackspace hosting
services](http://www.rackspace.com) to free up the company IT team.
“It’s far too easy to fall into the trap of doing everything in-house
and waste your IT talent managing email servers instead of growing your
business,” explained John-Paul Narowski, Founder of KarmaCRM. “Our
business is CRM, not IT, and everything we can do to help keep that in
the forefront helps us remain lightweight and competitive.”

Hosted email solutions provide continual support on a 24x7x365 basis,
allowing business owners and employees to focus on core operations,
rather than back-end issues. Service providers, such as Rackspace,
provide organizations with a staff of experts to address network issues
in a timely manner, as well as in-depth set-up support. Transition
representatives also are provided to allow companies to easily migrate
from free email services to new, hosted platforms, efficiently.

“We are not a tech company — we don’t have a lot of technical
expertise,” said Vranas of PROACT Search. “The Transition Team [from
Rackspace] was super helpful in getting us setup, speaking in plain
English, and not talking down to us.”

Conversely, organizations that subscribe to free email services are
simply left to consult message boards and help forums, where they will,
hopefully, find a solution to any technical issues and answers to any
follow-up questions.

“As a general rule, a paid email provider has a greater obligation and
financial motivation to take care of your information and mail,” Averett
said. “However, the most critical piece is support, which is
non-existent in free email platforms. If one of your critical
communication tools doesn’t have any back-up behind it, in terms of a
human being that can help you find a missing message or track something
down, that’s a big problem for businesses.”

### Communication & Client Protection: The Free Email Game-Changer

Information and conversation protection is key to maintaining business
integrity and sustaining relationships. Free email platforms often flood
inboxes with advertisements and can easily access emails and
information, leading to increased likelihood that customer and partner
data will be compromised. This is a factor that many organizations
ignore, due to the appeal of obtaining a service for free, according to
Averett.

“The average [small business] today uses the email that was included
when they purchased a domain name, or a free domain that came with an
Internet provider, or possibly a Yahoo! or Gmail,” Averett explained.

“To keep company and customer confidentiality top- of-mind,
organizations must implement solutions that focus on email and are
willing to provide features for security during message storage and
transmission. Hosting companies integrate extensive security measures to
help you protect data from physical threats, and other circumstances,
including overheating, power outages, and fires. However, the continual
protection of hosted systems is a key benefit of hosted solutions.

### Conclusion: Building Business Relationships & Opportunities With Hosted Email Solutions

As businesses continue to veer toward digital channels to build and
maintain relationships, as well as increase business, it is becoming
more imperative for small business to follow suit, and most importantly,
be armed with optimal resources.

Although smartphones and social tools are becoming ubiquitous in the
business world, email still remains the solid foundation of all
corporate communications, making a reliable email platform a vital asset
to business productivity, profitability, and performance.

[Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Managed Hosting,
2012](http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=223238), revealed
key characteristics for an efficient service. The report read: “The most
heavily weighted criteria for a hoster’s ability to execute are service
offering and service excellence, as reflected in the customer experience
with sales, support, and operations.”

Optimal email hosting solutions allow organizations across sizes and
segments to streamline operations and to help ensure optimal email
deliverability, uptime, and security. Providers also offer collaboration
for employees and business owners to be constantly connected and are
able to share status updates, events, and communications; ensuring
streamlined and successful business operations.

With a reliable and sustainable email platform on hand, small businesses
are armed with the tools, resources, and support to optimize brand
perception, and drive productivity as well as performance, for continued
business growth and success.

### The Hosted Service Advantage

To truly succeed in a highly competitive and connected marketplace,
small businesses need sturdy and reliable email platforms. Hosted email
service providers cover the gamut to deliver optimal email performance.
By implementing a hosted email service, small businesses will receive
the following benefits:

-   **Support.** Most businesses operate across multiple time zones and at all
times, making a support team that is on call 24x7x365  a critical asset to help
ensure email performance is consistently on point.
-   **Uptime.** With email acting as the linchpin of all business communications
and relationships, it is vital that small businesses have optimal uptime and
deliverability. Since service and connectivity is key to keeping business
operations afloat, most hosted email service providers provide more than 99%
uptime.
-   **Backup and data recovery.** Leading hosted email solutions provide email
backup in case servers crash or stop responding. Recovery systems also are
available to restore any email messages that get lost in translation.
-   **Connectivity.** Small business owners and employees are constantly on the
go, formulating relationships, and attending important meetings and events to
create new sales opportunities. Hosted email solutions provide enterprises with
instant connectivity to BlackBerry, iPhone, and Android devices, as well as any
Internet-connected laptop, desktop or tablet, to help ensure optimal performance
and productivity to on-the-go team members.
-   **Collaboration.** Hosted platforms offer small businesses optimal resources
to help team members receive and share information. Collaboration tools include
project tracking, content management, and the sharing of calendars, and to-do
ists.
