### Exploring the Differences Between Email Backup & Email Archiving

Many organizations are now required by business best practices, industry
standards, and regulatory compliance requirements to maintain email data
for extensive periods of time. This presents the added challenge of
chasing ever-growing email storage capacity and, if running email
on-premises, incurring additional capital expenses to maintain and
upgrade storage infrastructure.

One of the first steps in planning your email data management strategy
is to understand the difference between email backup and email
archiving.

### What is an Email Backup?

A backup simply creates a copy or image of the current state of the
email system, which can be used to restore a system, or a previously
saved copy of the system. Companies managing their own email and backups
often struggle to keep efficiencies high and costs low. Requirements for
high media capacity, low storage cost per GB and high performance
read/write streaming capabilities often mean maintaining in-house
backups on magnetic tapes.

### What is Email Archiving?

On the other hand, an email archive is generally considered a historical
reference that can be accessed less frequently and is placed outside of
the backup cycle. Archival storage requirements differ from those of
backup operations and are characterized by data authenticity, media
longevity, high performance random read access, and low total cost of
ownership. The storage media used for archival processes must be stable
with a long life as, in some cases, email data must be stored over
multiple years.

### The Difference

In most self-managed (or on premise) email environments, storage and
backup administrators are responsible for the recovery and security of
the data, while data archiving is left to information architects and
application administrators to help meet the legal and regulatory
compliance.

Email archiving allows you to search, report and export massive volumes
of archived email data, with no retention limitations, versus backups
that simply store email system and/or file information according to a
set retention period (normally shorter).

### Market Trends

With changing dynamics in the marketplace, businesses feel the pressure
to modernize traditional email backup and restore solutions to make them
more efficient and cost effective. The historical model of full backups
with incremental data capture is increasingly being viewed as antiquated
and ineffective at keeping up with decreasing backup windows and
increasing service-level expectations. All at a time when businesses are
trying to reduce the cost and time involved in maintaining IT
infrastructures. This creates a scenario where businesses need the right
balance between email data management functionality and cost.

A recent survey by Gartner in 2011 shows that 57% of SMBs retain
archived data for at least one year.<sup>1</sup> However, this is down from
65%<sup>2</sup> from 2010, indicating that as organizations mature, unneeded
data is better recognized and retained for shorter periods of time.
Organizations prefer their email archival processes to provide advanced
search capabilities and total data access across defined archive
retention policies. This makes email archiving an attractive tool for
organizations looking for help in meeting long-term information
retention management and compliance goals.

The same Gartner survey also indicates that 39% of SMBs are either
currently using or interested in archiving data to the cloud. The
attractiveness of not having to manage the archive infrastructure
in-house combined with the maturity of [cloud email archiving
solutions](http://www.rackspace.com/email-hosting/archiving-backup/);
drive organizations to view the cloud as a viable archiving alternative.
Companies have quickly begun to realize that cloud storage environments
provide more IT agility in managing the constant growth of data and
changing workload demands.

### Leveraging the Cloud for Email Data Management

Many organizations have backup strategies in place and treat backup and
archiving processes the same way. In this case, old, redundant and
infrequently accessed data is being backed up over and over leading to
increased storage costs. Some firms that do employ both backup and
archiving often do not align policies for retention and deletion,
resulting in data continuously being backed up, again leading to
increased storage costs.

One obvious solution to improve efficiency, cost and effectiveness is to
turn to the cloud for a complete email solution. [Hosted
email](http://www.rackspace.com/email-hosting/), coupled with archiving
can dramatically reduce an organization’s email IT spend, negating the
need for costly capital outlays, growing physical and human resources
and the ongoing day-to-day burden of email management and growing data
volumes.

Cloud-based email archiving helps companies reduce costs of storing and
managing massive amounts of static data, often offering capabilities
such as full-text indexing, real-time search, and long-term storage for
seldom-accessed, inactive data.

### Three Reasons Businesses Prefer Hosted Email Archiving

1.  **Reduced storage costs** – Organizations are often challenged by the rapid
growth in data that needs to be maintained, resulting in increased email costs.
By archiving files with a cloud-powered email service provider, you eliminate
the need for costly and difficult-to-maintain email and storage infrastructure.
2.  **Increased capability** – Most organizations are facing an unexpected
growth in data across the organization. Hosted email archiving lets the IT team
offload the email storage and retention burden to the cloud. This serves as a
one-stop shop for all your email data and can streamline the search and retrieval
process to help meet compliance requests in a timely manner.
3.  **Reduced complexity** – Without an effective archiving process, demands for
email search and retrieval can be overwhelming. Shifting email archiving to the
cloud puts complex management tasks behind a simple web-interface that easily
integrates with your email client.
