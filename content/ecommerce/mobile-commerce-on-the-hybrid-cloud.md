### INTRODUCTION

Smartphones, tablets, and, in the near future, watches, eyewear and
other wearables, will emerge as new points of sale. Online retailers
with a well planned, flawlessly executed, and tightly integrated mobile
presence stand to gain the most. More impulse buys come from mobile,
with clothes, books, and music noted as leading impulse buys<sup>1</sup>. In
2014, mobile commerce will rise to $57 billion<sup>2</sup>. By 2017, mobile is
poised to represent nearly a third of all digital sales at $115
billion<sup>3</sup>. In 2013, physical and digital retailer, Target raked in 43
percent of its digital sales from mobile-only users<sup>4</sup>.

Savvy mobile shoppers use their devices for more than just clicking the
“Buy Now” button. According to a 2013 survey from Deloitte<sup>5</sup>,
smartphone owners used their devices to find store locations (56
percent), check and compare prices (54 percent) and get product
information (47 percent). Mobile is disrupting the way we browse a
store’s showroom. Over a third of users report consulting mobile devices
in-store to compare retailers and one out of five go mobile in the store
to view products on the store’s website<sup>6</sup>. More importantly for
retailers, mobile shoppers were prepared to spend 27 percent more on
holiday gifts than non-smartphone owners<sup>7</sup>.

The mobile movement isn’t just for traditional retailers. By integrating
mobile into insurance claims processing, the process has become 30
percent more efficient<sup>18/sup>. Looking ahead to 2015, over 80 percent of
insurers plan to be using mobile technologies in claims, customer
service and field sales<sup>9</sup>. Forrester predicts mobile banking will be
used by nearly half of U.S bank account holders, over 100 million users,
by 2017<sup>10</sup>. Mobile is emerging as a key competitive driver for banking
customers with six in ten stating that the quality of mobile banking
services as a key decision point in switching banks<sup>11</sup>.

These trends put mobile application developers under increasing pressure
to enhance mobile performance, scalability, and reliability. Usage of
mobile apps alone overtook desktop usage in February 2014<sup>12</sup>, yet only
a third of organizations have the methodologies, processes, and
expertise to properly test their mobile applications<sup>13</sup>. However, over
half of organizations list performance efficiency as their main priority
for mobile testing<sup>14</sup>.

As users move away from desktop apps to faster, more accessible mobile
devices, smart TVs, wearable devices and beyond, mobile developers need
better tools to optimize and test infrastructure to efficiently run code
regardless of location or device.

### BARRIERS TO GOING MOBILE

Though the benefits of going mobile retail are clear, the path to
execute is rife with pitfalls. Obstacles include:

-   **Choosing a mobile-enabled ecommerce platform.** Review your mobile
experience goals against current capabilities as you evaluate a new platform or
embark on a platform upgrade. Your users expect an experience that adheres to
mobile design best practices and integrates native device features (camera,
video, GPS, messaging) to use mobile-enhanced features like click-to-call,
location tracking, barcode scanning, and social sharing. Older platforms aren’t
equipped, leaving some retailers to cobble together disparate solutions that
negatively impact customer experience. Executing your ideal mobile experience
often requires a platform switch or upgrade, no easy task when you consider
all of the elements included in a re-platforming project.


-   **Performance upgrades.** If your mobile site or application takes more than
three-seconds to load, 37 percent of mobile users will go to your
competitor<sup>15</sup>. One in seven desktop carts abandon due to performance
but one in nine mobile carts are lost due to performance issues<sup>16</sup>.
Performance is the most critical factor to mobile success. Enhanced performance
is driven by platform and infrastructure choices. To get the level of performance
mobile users expect may mean re-engineering or re-architecting complex enterprise
business processes and workflows to reap performance efficiencies. With a
cloud-first approach, utilizing hybrid cloud technology to support scale and
delivery while integrating legacy apps on dedicated or on-premises hardware,
retailers can decrease upfront spend and ongoing maintenance costs.


-   **Getting to Market.** For many retailers, changing platform and
infrastructure can take months or years. Long lag times for launch are often due
to the resource and expertise constraints of competing in a fast-changing
industry. Acquiring talent versed in mobile infrastructure is not only costly but
also difficult to do with a small pool of qualified applicants available. Even
with the right fit, justifying the mobile spend is a challenge. Along with
executing a major shift to mobile, IT must balance existing sales and marketing
goals with current IT housekeeping tasks. To avoid this pitfall, retailers are
integrating infrastructure and support partners to take the cumbersome deployment
and maintenance tasks off of their plate to go mobile faster and maintain a
competitive edge.

### KEYS TO MOBILE COMMERCE SUCCESS

-   **Responsive design:** Slim down the work of mobile design using responsive
design—a single site designed to adapt visually to the endpoint device.

-   **Optimized site structure:** Similar to a desktop site, principles of lean
coding, compression, caching, and reduction of third-party apps leads to faster
performance.

-   **High performing architecture:** Focusing on a hybrid cloud approach to
leverage existing legacy apps with cloud-based resources helps reduce speed to
market and allows for enhanced scale and reliability after launch.

**What is Hybrid Cloud?**

Merges public cloud resources with private cloud, dedicated hardware, or
an on-premises environment to extend the elasticity and flexibility of
network, storage, and compute resources in an on-demand, pay-as-you go
model.

**Why Hybrid?**

-   **Integration:** By connecting infrastructure pieces, organizations gain
better alignment and visibility for more efficient management.

-   **Scale:** Linking to the public cloud for autoscaling with on-demand
resources reduces hardware spend and on-going maintenance costs.

**Why use hybrid cloud for mobile retail?**

-   Take advantage of cloud scalability while using dedicated servers to
securely process payment transactions and compliance-sensitive data.


-   Manage traffic spikes with on-demand resources that you don’t have to
maintain year round. Own the base and rent the spike.

-   Run workloads where they get the highest performance for the lowest total cost.

### HOW HYBRID CLOUD POWERS MOBILE COMMERCE

Hybrid is becoming a defacto standard for enterprises with nearly
three-quarters of large enterprises expecting to have hybrid deployments
by 2015<sup>17</sup>. With respect to mobile commerce, hybrid cloud offers the
following unique benefits:

-   **Supporting high concurrency.** With more devices in the hands of  more
users, your mobile site will soon see more traffic than your desktop site.
According to OnDevice Research, mobile purchasing kicks off during the morning
commute and grows throughout day with the highest spikes recorded during the
afternoon commute<sup>18</sup>. When your mobile site or app experiences traffic
spikes at the same time of day or for a big promotional event, hybrid cloud
helps you instantly scale up to account for traffic without degrading
performance.


-   **Global content serving.** With content delivery capabilities and global
server footprints, hybrid cloud enhanced with CDN service enables fast,
high-quality page loads and split-second processing, regardless of location or
device.


-   **Reshaping ROI/TCO.** Standing up complex ecommerce platform software and
architecture to support massive scale for temporary spikes bleeds profits.
Hybrid helps you get a better return on IT investments by allowing more
flexibility with less maintenance and labor.
