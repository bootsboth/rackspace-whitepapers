Ecommerce refers to the sum of all interactions a customer has with your
business across website, mobile, and other digital experiences. The more
a customer shops on your website, the more likely they are to refer
their friends and family. The brand experience you create online is
integral to bringing shoppers back and spreading your reputation by
word-of-mouth to attract new customers.

Starting with a basic ecommerce strategy helps you identify and plan for
gaps, account for compliance, and support customer satisfaction by
considering all of the moving parts of your store. Without a strategy,
you could face:

-   Confusing layouts that result in increased bounce rates
-   Security issues causing lost trust and bad press
-   Lack of compliance, resulting in big fines or an inability to take payments
-   Bad resource planning which might lead to outages that disable sales

The desired customer outcome should drive the business focus, the
technologies used, and the security measures implemented to build trust,
loyalty, repeat business, and referrals.

### Elements of Ecommerce Strategy

The path a merchant takes to build their ideal customer experience is
unique to their industry, brand vision, and goals, but should include
these elements:

-   User-based strategy for aesthetics and purchase paths
-   Platform selection, including a plan for re-platforming, where applicable
-   Market-appropriate mobile functionality unique from your desktop site
-   Security and compliance measures as dictated by your industry
-   Peak traffice preparedness including load testing and performance
benchmarking

In this paper, we'll cover the basics of each element as a starting
point to building and executing your optimal customer experience.

#### User-based Focus

Think like a customer. This begins with considering the look, feel, and
flow of your online presence, and extends through your social media
efforts and other online activities. Your home page should say "hello"
like a sales clerk would in a physical store, and lead the user through
your site with relevant prompts, information placement, image sizes,
design consistency, logical navigation, and a safe atmosphere.

Use dynamic pages to serve custom content based on the user profile. For
example, a sporting goods retailer could display a home page that
highlights camping gear. A previous user who had browsed for tents may
see this homepage, while a user that had browsed jet skis might be
served up entirely different content. Enhanced search capabilities give
users a quick way to find exactly what they're looking for when they
don't want to browse the site. Adding content that supports the buying
process like reviews, multiple product views, and live chat helps foster
experiences that turn site browsers into loyal customers.

To determine which features are right for your product and customers,
use analytics and customer surveys. That will help you to find out
what's working or missing now. Executing the most advanced features may
mean more than just changing text and images. Instead, you may need to
rethink or revamp existing database schemas and ways to scale systems to
account for the collection, storage, and manipulation of new types of
data.

Guide](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/the-ecommerce-customer-experience/)
for help building out your customer experience strategy.*

#### Choosing Your Ecommerce Store Platform

Your ecommerce platform consists the software, such as
[Magento](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/), [Oracle
Commerce](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/oracle-retail/),
[Adobe](http://www.rackspace.com/wcm/aem/), or others, along with the
infrastructure selected to run that software.

The software decision should be based on your customer experience goals.
If your site needs the option to configure individual products but your
ecommerce software doesn't support it, you can't offer the experience
you've planned. Similarly, running a resource-heavy ecommerce platform
on under-performing hardware yields a losing proposition as customers
bounce due to slow page loads. Your options for ecommerce infrastructure
include:

-   **Cloud**: Takes advantage of massively scalable infrastructure and
pre-configured or highly customizable environments to reduce hardware and
management burdens. Choose a [public cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public)
for low cost or [private cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/) for
workloads subject to stringent security or compliance mandates.
-   **On-premises**: Puts the burden of hardware, security, performance, and
scale on your IT team and your budget. This gives you ultimate control with all
the headaches that accompany being responsible for the entire ecommerce
infrastructure.
-   **[Hybrid Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/)**: Combines
on-premises or [dedicated hardware](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/)
with cloud resources to achieve cloud efficiencies while meeting certain security
or compliance needs. In a hybrid environment, a retailer can opt to move certain
workloads, like [email](http://www.rackspace.com/email-hosting/) or
[content delivery](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/technology/?page=cdn),
to the cloud while maintaining control over other critical systems best run on
dedicated or on-premises gear.

*Read [Ecommerce Replatforming
Basics](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/ecommerce-re-platforming-basics/)
for more guidance on planning and executing a replatforming project.*

#### Mobile Functionality

The mobile experience leverages mobile-specific functionality, like
click-to-call, GPS integration for maps or geo-targeting, gesture
recognition, and others. Imagine trying to geo-target customers in a
downtown area with slow servers that don't deliver the notification
until hours later.

*Mobile commerce (Mcommerce) accounts for 1 in 10 e-commerce dollars and
is set to grow to $86 billion by 2016<sup>2</sup>.*

Mobile also comes with a whole new set of usability rules. The depth of
content on your website has to shrink for smaller screens while elements
like buttons and images need more screen space to accommodate mobile
tapping. Placement of social plug-ins and shopping cart operation also
need to be simplified to enhance, not clutter, the purchase path.

Over the years, businesses have approached their mobile and desktop
platforms with separate strategies. This often resulted in a
mobile-optimized version of a site and/or an accompanying native mobile
app. However, maintaining a desktop and mobile app in isolation often
leads to disconnected experiences and user dissatisfaction when the
newer mobile app doesn't flow or operate in the same way as the
traditional desktop site. Responsive design enables ecommerce operators
to design a single site that displays differently on different devices,
an approach that saves resources by reusing images, and content. This
allows for a consistent visual and content experience across desktop,
mobile and tablet devices.

stacks](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/develop-mobile-apps-quickly-on-the-rackspace-cloud/)

#### Peak Traffic Preparedness

Nearly half of companies (48%) report that downtime negatively impacts
their brand and reputation<sup>3</sup>. The inability to maintain operations
during a fault or a spike is an enormous risk to an ecommerce site. If
your environment encounters an issue with a patch, an update to code, a
service or hardware component failure, or a natural disaster, what
happens to your site? Do you have a contingency plan for expected and
unexpected downtime issues? Documenting your ecommerce strategy lets you
identify and address infrastructure needs that might negatively impact
performance.

Stress testing, the equivalent of running a "fire drill" on your site,
is integral to understanding site operations and where optimizations are
needed. Every system has physical limits and most ecommerce environments
are unique. Under stress, a site may reveal a weakness or a break in
operation, letting you tune your site to mitigate the risk before angry
customer feedback or social media backlash.

Build in yearly or quarterly performance testing, ideally during slow
periods so that primary systems aren't impacted. Testing should evaluate
performance throughout the entire ecommerce environment - from network
throughput to disk I/O, the speed of failover, and even memory or CPU
utilization - as one weak link can break the entire environment.

Ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASDViz2iSz8&feature=youtu.be)
video for guidance on calculating downtime costs and planning disaster
recovery.*

#### Compliance & Security Measures

Ecommerce transactions build consumer trust by limiting the risk of
fraudulent activities while ensuring the privacy of consumer
information. However, in nine years, the Verizon Data Breach
Investigations Report has recorded over 1.2 billion breached records
with 24% of breaches attributed to retail transactions<sup>4</sup>. These records
include credit card numbers, personally identifiable information, or
cardholder data that was lost, stolen, or accessed without
authorization.

To minimize this risk, the Payment Card Industry (PCI) created a
commission, the [Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI
SSC)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/role_of_pci_council.php),
charged with setting and maintaining the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standards (PCI DSS). PCI DSS helps alleviate the
vulnerabilities associated with the transmission, storage, and
processing of cardholder data, specifically the Primary Account Number.

*6% of businesses in 2012 that were subject to PCI DSS and suffered a
breach were not in compliance<sup>5</sup>.*

Achieving compliance with PCI DSS is a continuous process of performing
assessments, remediation efforts, and reporting the results. The Council
maintains a [library of
documentation](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php)
to help merchants and service providers mitigate risk and maintain
secure online transactions.

Businesses that utilize online transactions must first identify
potential risks both to the consumer and to the business itself. If the
existing resources cannot sufficiently and reliably perform those
functions, consider a solution that best fits your business model and
protects all parties involved according to PCI DSS. Ecommerce sites have
three ways to meet the PCI DSS requirements:

-   Use a payment gateway which involves integration with an Application Program
Interface (API) to facilitate the transmission of the Primary Account Number
with or without the storage of this information
-   Transmit and store the Primary Account Number internally
-   Choose to outsource the transmission, storage and/or processing of payment
data

Ultimately, the route an organization takes to meet the requirements of
PCI DSS is a business decision and should be evaluated carefully.

#### Overall Site Security

PCI DSS covers best practices for the protection of sensitive cardholder
information. There is little guidance on how to secure ecommerce
elements outside of PCI compliance. DDoS attacks and email-borne viruses
can still grind the operations of a compliant site to a halt.

The systems (server, storage, software, etc.) that support ecommerce
transactions can be costly to secure and manage. These types of
workloads are where [hybrid cloud
solutions](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/) are gaining adoption.
With a hybrid cloud approach, merchants can take advantage of cloud
efficiencies while maintaining compliant systems to actually transmit,
process, and/or store cardholder information on dedicated or on-premises
gear.

Cloud](https://support.rackspace.com/whitepapers/pci-compliance-in-rackspace-hybrid-cloud/).*

### Getting Started

#### Mapping Site Flow and Process

Site flow is usually mapped using flowcharts or software that lets you
visually layout purchase paths. The following list represents basic
elements of site flow categorized into business, technical, and
customer-facing activities. Your site may have more or less elements
based on your experience goals:

Business:

-   Marketing campaign, sales promotion, or media mention drives customers to
website
-   Social media activity stimulates traffic
-   Internal/employees access site for reference

Customer:

-   Users access site using an internet browser and their desktop, mobile, or
tablet device
-   Request travels over the Internet (caching name servers/root name servers)

Technical:

-   Registered URL configured to resolve to a Public IP Address through DNS then
IP resolved to an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
-   IP Address request sent through a series of routers to your data center
-   IP Address and port number (80-http/443-https) travel through a series of
switches
-   Web service server accepts the request and responds with content or sends a
request to a database server
-   Information travels back to the customer for each request

Customer:

-   Views the requested data
-   Makes a decision to continue browsing the site
-   Adds an item to the web application/shopping cart
-   Continues through the check-out process

Technical:

-   Checkout and/or site registration process must adhere to privacy regulations
-   Payment gateways must meet compliance guidelines
-   Confirm payment method used

Business:

-   Generate purchase confirmation
-   Transactional and order follow-up communication
-   Inventory and fulfillment coordination

#### The Inventory

Once you've mapped the site flow, creating the inventory helps you
define the individual components you already have, or that you need to
have, in order to execute site flow and processes as planned. A
well-developed inventory guides the strategy that delivers a superior
user experience. It can also uncover areas for improvement and those
areas no one thinks about until something goes wrong, like security or
shopping cart functionality. An ecommerce site's inventory may include:

<img src="{% asset_path ecommerce/building-your-ecommerce-strategy/RackspaceEcommerce-BuildingSoundEcommerceStrategy-2.png %}" width="273" height="236" />

These items span across departments. All stakeholders should point out
aspects of their particular focus that are not represented. For example,
examining the inventory from a business perspective may point out that
marketing isn't listed, and without marketing there wouldn't be any
customers visiting the site. The technical perspective will uncover
hardware or data center deficiencies. The security perspective can
evaluate firewalls, SSL certificates, or the 200+ other requirements
that should be considered for an ecommerce site.

Creating a vetted inventory is exhausting, however it's an important
first step to understanding how all of your site's pieces work together.
Once you've completed this inventory, you'll have a better understanding
of what you need to do to implement the technologies and processes
needed to support your site.

### Summary

According to the 2014 Forrester and Shop.org study, "The State of
Retailing Online," repeat customers accounted for 51% of website
revenues. That four in ten of your competitors are planning a site
overhaul this year<sup>6</sup> means it might be time for you to take a look at
or update your ecommerce strategy so you don't get left behind.

**Compliance**

"It is probably true to say that without the considerable amount of help
from Rackspace, we could not have passed the exceptionally stringent PCI
audit. Rackspace certainly went above and beyond their remit to ensure
that everything was perfect for us."
Aingaran Somaskandarajah
Technical Lead, Oyster Card

**Availability**

"Our traffic and business can increase 100 times to 1,000 times what
they were in the off-season. We have to scale on and off, but we also
have to try to not carry too much infrastructure in the off-season.
That's why we went with the Rackspace Hybrid Cloud based on
[RackConnect™](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/) - we
split our application between a dedicated private infrastructure for our
checkout process; and we use the public cloud for product descriptions,
prices and other information."
Steve Vitale
Director of Ecommerce, Spencer Gifts

**Performance**

"With Rackspace, Karmaloop can deploy a variety of state of the art
servers whenever necessary, bring those servers to scale quickly, which
fundamentally allows the company to keep the user performance great,
page load time very fast, and provide Karmaloop customers with an uptime
of 100%."
Gary Rush
CTO, Karmaloop

**Mobile**

"Rackspace's reliability gives Acquity Group the freedom to focus on
creating great apps and onboarding customers without worrying about
infrastructure."
Kevin Ellenwood
Vice President of Shared Services, Acquity Group Part of Accenture
Interactive

**Cost Effectiveness**

"Cloud gives us flexibility and cost savings and I can't see why we
cannot move as much as 80% of our total workloads to the cloud,
including business-critical apps and mobile workloads,"
Colin Rees
IT Director, Domino's Pizza
